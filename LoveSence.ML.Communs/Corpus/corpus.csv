illegitime,[Kian:] So here we stand In our secret place With a sound of the crowd So far away And you take my hand And it feels like home We both understand It’s where we belong [Bryan:] So how do I say? Do I say goodbye? We both have our dreams We both wanna fly So let’s take tonight To carry us through The lonely times [CHORUS:] [All:] I’ll always look back As I walk away This memory Will last for eternity And all of our tears Will be lost in the rain When I’ve found my way Back to your arms again But until that day You know you are The queen of my heart [Bryan:] Queen of my heart [Shane:] So let’s take tonight And never let go While dancing we’ll kiss Like there’s no tomorrow As the stars sparkle down Like a diamond ring I’ll treasure this moment Till we meet again [Mark: (All:)] But no matter how far (Matter how far) Or where you may be (Where you may be) I just close my eyes (I just close my eyes) And you’re in my dreams And there you will be Until we meet [Repeat chorus twice] [Shane: (All:)] Oh yeah
illegitime,"“I smiled to many people for more than a billion times; but when I first found you, my heart took over and smiled for the first time.” … This is how much I knew it is you I have been searching for all my life. “Your presence in my life brings wonderful smiles and loving thoughts within my heart.” … And so shall it be until the end of time “To love is to place our happiness in the happiness of another.” … That we are happy together is all I ever wanted and will ever want for the rest of my life “Kiss slowly, love deeply, forgive quickly. Life is too short for you to be disappointed any longer.” … I promise on my life honey… I promise to love you endlessly and our secrets shall always remain our secrets not to reveal to any other person; only between you and I “Just when I thought that love could never be a part of me, that’s when you came along and showed me happiness!” … Thank you for your endless love and I’m so happy we both appreciate every moment of our relationship since we found each other."

Please enjoy your day. Love ya! PS- I’ll call you and let you know when I get my payment. I am more than happy my love, you just can’t imagine! Thank you for every thing and I promise to refund all your money soon."
illegitime,"A POEM FOR YOU I NEED YOU MORE… THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOUR FACE, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS IN THE PICTURE I THOUGHT THE SUN ROSE IN YOUR EYES AND THE MOON AND THE STARS WERE THE GIFT YOU GAVE ME THE FIRST TIME EVER I KISSED YOUR MOUTH EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ON THE SCREEN OF MY SYSTEM, I FELT THE EARTH WOULD TURN IN MY HAND THE FIRST TIME EVER I LAY WITH YOU, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS IN MY DREAM, I FELT YOUR HEART CLOSE TO MINE AND I KNEW OUR JOY WOULD FILL THE EARTH AND WOULD LAST TILL THE END OF THIS WORLD FOR ALL THOSE TIME YOU OPENED MY EYES AND ALL THE TRUTH YOU MADE ME SEE FOR ALL THE JOY YOU BROUGHT TO MY LIFE FOR ALL THE LOVE I FOUND IN YOU"
illegitime,"Absolutely I have come to know that we spend most of our life seeking for the secondary needs, while our primary needs are left unseen. We have worked so hard and attained some wealth right? But for what purpose? To be realistic, except if you just want to be known as a rich person, wealth means nothing if you have no best friend to share it with. All the millions are useless indeed. How much do we need to eat? How much do we need for shelter? How much do we need for daily fun? Excess and excess leads us to vanity. But for few of us who value the simplicity, we sure would do well in finding happiness. As I always say, money can buy a good bed, but never will money buy sleep; It can buy the best diamond watch, but can never buy time; it can buy piles of books, but cant buy knowledge; it can buy food, but not satisfaction; MONEY can buy sex, but can NEVER buy love. That is why I refuse to follow the crowd. So as my own man, I would give up all that can be bought for that which cant be bought. I want true joy and happiness. I want my woman to have power over my moods."
illegitime,"After reviewing the whole work, they questioned the difference in doors and I tried to explain every thing, hoping they would comprehend but instead, they brought out our agreement, reminded me of what I promised to use and never to default. I spent time trying to make them understand that it was the market cost of these things that dragged me into such decision but yet, they wouldn’t comprehend. I again asked if they could pay a part of my money and the question that followed was, ‘sir Ben Gold, why are we paying you $30Million if we need someone to use our own money to execute the project?’ I told them I really do understand they are paying three times my invested capital but as the situation is, I would need few thousands to change the doors. We argued over this for long and at a point in time, they almost got incensed with my explanation and concluded they only came with my check as issued from the head quarter in Dubai and no way for them to pay a part of the money. They also advised that I get the job done as quickly as possible so I don’t get penalized for long delay."
illegitime,"An adult with an open-heart. A man who puts a smile on your face everyday. I will be that man who’s there for you just as you’re there for me, the one who encourages you through life’s ups and downs. But ultimately, I want to be the man who is your everything. Not a second goes by that I don’t think about you. You have brought so much joy to my life and you give me so much to look forward to when I wake up every morning. I want you to know that I sincerely appreciate you and I can never tell you enough that “I LOVE YOU!” Already you got my head swollen and my stomach full of butterflies. You make me feel like entering into these words and just come out from your computer when you log on into your email to check this message. I really need to exercise myself enough to receive all the hugs awaiting me. I wonder what to call you my love, I think you are the number one criminal in the world. You are a perfect ‘heart robber’ for stealing all my heart without leaving even a space for me. How wonderful you are my heart robber! LOL. Please take good care of yourself and have a splendid day. Thinking of you~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ XOXOXOXOXOXOX"
illegitime,Anyone can be cool but awesomeness like yours takes practice.
illegitime,"Are you a God fearing woman? I am a God fearing man, I do have my Christian faith to credit for my life, attitude and success; however, I don't use the name of God to attract women for my character speaks for itself. I am not the type of man who is focused entirely on himself."
illegitime,Are you a left or right handed person? I am a right handed person
illegitime,"Are you a sports fan? And what are your favorite sports? I have a passion for sports and my favorite sport is football and I also like Sea Fishing, kayaking, boating, sailing are my sports of choice. I’m not afraid to speak my mind, trust my gut, and follow my heart. Even if it gets me in trouble...lol"
illegitime,"Are you financially stable? Yes of course I am financially stable, I do receive a high income from my Job so there's no need for me to be afraid of any financial situation."
illegitime,"Are you willing to relocate if you find your soul mate? For me it depends on my soul mate; If she willingly wants me relocate to Her Home, its okay with me, but if she likes to relocate to my Home that will be fine so long as we stick together as ONE, Perhaps she might want us to Buy another Home, it fine as long as she's the happiest Woman on Earth"
illegitime,"As regards all our conversation, the things we have known about each other, the lovely pictures, I make bold to say, ‘I love you!’ I want you to look at those pictures of ours, do you ever think any other person could match us? My answer is NO! We are created for each other. No matter who we are, no matter how stone hearted we may be, every human being knows what they feel immediately they see the opposite sex, be it in the picture or physically. If you feel just likeness for someone, you know. If you feel like having sex with someone, you know. If you feel you want someone to be yours forever, you also know. All these feelings are our bodies telling us what they want. But instead of most people giving their bodies and spirit what they want, they tend to give them bad food, I mean bad partners. And you know, the bodies will reject them either immediately or someday. You might have been through a terrible past just like me, but it shouldn’t destroy our yet to come, beautiful future. Because, if we close our eyes and wait for all the bad people of this world to pass by, the good ones will also pass and we won’t notice."
illegitime,"At that point, what he was saying wasn’t what I wanted to hear so I just grabbed my check from him and walked out. I went on to another different bank and on to another one and on to another one and on to five different banks and I heard the same statement. Dear, you can’t imagine how I was sweating inside air condition. I felt so sad and so I decided to go and see the ticketing agent who booked my flight. since I was not having a dime to pay him, I had to sit at his office and explain my situation to him. I never told him of the check I got because I don’t trust these people. I only told him I will send his money as soon as I get to the States but he will never comprehend. He threatened to cancel my flight if I don’t pay him. I told him to still reserve it and that I will get back to him. My love, I have faith that the god who protected us this far will also help us on the remaining part of our journey. Please let your mind be at peace now because I already got what I came here to work for. My check is in my own hand and that is a guarantee that you will get all you have ever loaned me or will ever loan me. I mean I don’t expect you to panic now regardless of the amount I may need. The flight is only South African Rand, R17,468.00 ($2,257.03). I am supposed to pay $60 for taxi and $180 for the truck to move my equipments to the airport. This brings every thing to a sum of $2,497.03. Though I have a $1,980 deficit at the hotel but I can still beg the manager to allow me pay when I get over and I know he would listen. He seems the only reasonable person I know here. Please honey, I don’t want to remain here. No matter how hard this has become, just relax your mind, it will all end in a matter of hours when I arrive. My luggage is all packed. I only need to pay the agent and move my things to the airport. Thank you for your support right from the beginning till now and forever. I know we will never give up on each other. I want to touch you, hug you and feel your breath on me starting from tomorrow on. PLEASE ATTEND TO THIS QUICKLY!!! I wait for your call or email. Missing you already…. Your Hero,"

illegitime,"Basically, all I do each business day is supervise the workers, monitor the jobs and make corrections and I have been doing this for more than one year. I know your mind is telling you it may be boring to do same thing each day (lol), but it’s never boring for I have the most interesting workers ever. We are like a large family and every one is always happy."
illegitime,"By the way, What kind of dates do u prefer?? Well as for me i prefer private dates, with my woman and myself alone. I guess i like the private moments when we can share intimate things. Talk about plans, desires, feelings. As I said before, I'm quite physical. I love to hug and touch and be touched. I love to show affection to my woman and i love it when she's very affectionate with me. I love women and i always desire to respect them. When i have been with a woman, i have never taken advantage of them unless they do took advantage of me. Even when they want me to be physical with them, I always want only to honor and respect them."
illegitime,"Can you tell me more about yourself??????. Well am really looking for a long term and serious relationship,I need a woman that will love me for whom i am,Make me happy again..Am also gonna show in a lot of caring ways in return,Am new on this dating stuff and i really hope i can make som,ething real with you and leave this internet stuff soon...."

illegitime,"Darling, I lost life when I lost Mary; I found you and you brought me back alive. I am living once again, thank you so much. Even though I have succeeded in other areas of life, if I have not found you, I would still be like an unfortunate man. Love is all we need to stay alive for real. This morning, I am writing you from the top of my office table standing on my feet because I am supposed to be outside with the inspection team, but when I stood up to go, I could not, your thought in my mind logged on into my google account and here I am still writing.lol. Dear, if you have been loved in the past, know that that love is not enough, if you have been happy in the past, know that you didn’t get the dept of happiness you deserve, if you ever have been caress in your life, know that you haven’t got a clue, when all this inspection of a thing is finally completed and I step into my flight coming to you, prepare yourself to be loved above all women, prepare your mind to be the happiest woman on earth and prepare your life to be caressed like never before, I will spoil you with every thing honey. I wish I didn’t have to miss you. If only you could be with me always. I know I could never be any happier. But then again, I know that the day is now, when I will be able to spend my every waking moment with you. I even miss you when I am sleeping!"
illegitime,"Dear Hon, Good morning to you. Thank you so much for all your love, care and support. Today, I woke up beside you. I felt your touch, your breath, your early morning smile and kiss. I wish I didn’t have to miss you. If only you could be with me always. I know I could never be any happier. But then again, I know that tomorrow I will be able to spend my every waking moment with you. I even miss you when I am sleeping! I love you, babe. You are my now and ever, my only love, and I thank you for being so kind with my heart. Hopefully, in less than 48hrs, I won’t have to hate missing you. I’m going to the warehouse now to arrange for how my equipments would be transported to the airport. Then I will come back to the hotel room to relax again and prepare for the long 32h45mins journey. I will call you when I’m about leaving for the airport. Feeling you in my hands already (lol). Love Always,"
illegitime,"Dear, I am not afraid and I can never be. I am bold and proud of you, I love you for you, not for any particular reason because the love I have for you is unquestionable, true love indeed! Love and death are things one can not question because you can not say where, when or how. Love catches up with us and we find our-self in deep dept. I love you unconditionally my …… This is why I have never asked any particular question because I know it doesn’t matter any way, I am in love already, to stay and never let go no matter what we go through. I understand love hurts especially when one does not get equal love but our love will never hurt honey, I promise on my life. I swear by the day I was born, the day I shall die and the day I shall rise again, I will love you through the thick and thin. I will love you through eternity. I will be your shoulder if you ever need a shoulder to lean on. I will be there for you through all seasons, weather, condition and any situation. For you, I will fly with the angels just to protect and guide you from any kind of worries. I will be there and never leave. On my life, I swear! Please promise me you will never hurt me nor break my heart too. All I’m asking is equal love, a love that is unconditional, true love that lives even after death. That is all I’m asking honey or is it too much (lol). As far as our love is reciprocal, we will be happy together cos we will always understand each other, tolerate one another and endure in any kind of situation. Our life will be filled with so much joy and fulfillment of heart. We will never cry nor have any reason to. I love you ……!"
illegitime,"Dear, I love you! And I love you! You have done for me, what no other person can do. You have loved me the way no one can ever do. You have brought to me, a kind of happiness no one can ever bring. You have walked with me in the darkest night no one else could dare. You have crossed with me, the most dangerous bridge. You have shown me, a commitment no one else could ever show. You have proved beyond doubt the reason for me to wanting to wake up every day. You have said to me, the best words ever. I feel like someone in paradise as the King of Kings and you the Queen of Queens. To love you through eternity, is no doubt. Good morning greatest of lovers. It’s Ben waking you with a smile. I LOVE YOU!"
illegitime,"Dear, I think about you every second of every day. When I fall asleep, my dreams are about you. When I wake up, I look at the empty pillow next to me and wish you were there looking into my eyes. I wish I could tell you how I really feel. Dear I want a long term relationship and one that will last forever but now we have to take it slow and get to know more about each other better."
illegitime,"Dear, if you are placed in the midst of a million women and I am to pick, I know I will figure you out without the least mistake. If the whole water, the oceans and the seas on earth, together with the ones in heaven are joined together and turned into ink; and the whole trees in the forest are turned into pen and I am told to write how much I adore you, I will use all the ink and pen and still have more to write. If I am to count how much I treasure you with the stones on earth, I bet I will empty the earth and will have have more to count. Even when I die and I have the opportunity to make only one wish, I would still wish that we spend our eternal life together in heaven."
illegitime,"Dear, today was more brief as the professions would not discuss any further but concluded they won’t start any work until they have the first $40k in hand. I have no choice, I contacted Nelson immediately and glory be to God, he would help me with $15k with the $15k I have with me which means I would have $30k by tomorrow when Nelson sends the money. I also have a pure white gold wrist watch that I bought for $7k when I was in Dubai. I will take it to the pawn shop tomorrow and see what I can get on it. But even if I get the same $7k, I will still be looking for $3k. Who else do I turn to? I have thought over this again and again but what can I do? If I can tell a friend my problem and he listens and ready to help, why won’t I be able to share it with my own wife."
illegitime,"Dear, you bring to me a happiness no one else has before. You bring to me a love I have never known before. I could not imagine what my life would be like without you. I know that I don’t want to even imagine. You have touched my heart in ways no one could ever comprehend. I love being with you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. My Wonderful angel there is nothing on this Earth that I could ever give you that would ever come close to how I feel about you. I want to be with you for the rest of your life, and I know you feel the same. If only you knew how much I want to stay in your life. Love Always,"
illegitime,"Dearest , I am in the middle of work and very busy now. You already make me feel like the luckiest man on earth. I will write you again first thing when I’m free cos I’ll be thinking and thinking of you all through. My dream is to travel to all the beautiful places and see all the wonders in the world with my woman. I can’t wait to be on the London eye side by side with my woman, to be in Paris to see my mother and all its beauty, in the gorgeous Sydney Australia, in the beautiful Bahamas, once again in Dubai to spend time together in my house (if I haven’t found a tenant before then) and the rest of the world. Meeting you and hopefully, starting a new life with you is the surest thing. Just be patient, I will be retired in only few weeks. Sending smiles~"
illegitime,"Dearest LO, Baby, you have been gone for almost a century (lol), and only yesterday, your voice tells me you are always with me. I wish you were right here with me now so it wouldn’t be so hard for me to lay lonely in bed. I can’t help but to love you with every beat of my heart, and with every ounce of my soul. You are the absolute best thing to ever happen in my life. And, you are the most sensitive, caring, tender, considerate, loving woman I have ever met. You are simply amazing. I would never dream of letting you go, and I wouldn’t be able to live another breath in this world if I didn’t have you on my side, as my wife, lover, and friend."
illegitime,"Dearest LO, Good morning to you. It’s the beginning of another brand new day and I was thinking about you, as usual.. No matter how much things screwed up, you were determined to keep our love alive. I’ll never be able to thank you enough for that. You are the reason I live, breathe, love and laugh. You mean everything to me. I want you to know how much I sincerely love the times we’ve spent communicating. It means so much to me. It truly seems like I’ve known you forever and I honestly can’t imagine life without you now. There will be no looking back, no second thoughts and no regrets. I want you and need only you … and that love will only grow stronger. Do not be scared my love. Sometimes life hits you with unexpected things that take you totally by surprise. All I can say is you’re the best surprise life has given me and your capacity for love, caring, and understanding never ceases to amaze me. I’ve truly been blessed by finding you and I’ll never let you go! Your VE"
illegitime,"Dearest One, Just had time to check my emails now and I just want to quickly reply to your message. Thank you for taking the time to read my long emails and replying to them. I know this isn’t our make but our destiny. We didn’t join the dating site because we already know we are going to meet one another but we joined because we are looking for our soul mates, I mean one created from our ribs and we are so lucky to find us. god, thank you! I don’t think there’s is something else I would have asked of. You are the best thing happening to me in many years honey and I pray that soon,"
illegitime,"Delay Darling, I have been trying to reach you on phone but I guess network has been a jerk. I am just coming back from the South Africa tax office, Johannesburg with the customs officer who is to find out about my tax payment on the equipments. Last night while I was already in the plane and my and equipments were till under check, just when the flight was about to get ready for us to take off. A custom man came in and called my name, they asked of my tax clearance on the equipments since I told them I used the equipments in their country working on a building project for over one year (14 Months). They wanted to call the tax office same time to verify if I am good to go but they were closed so they delayed me till this morning and promised that I would fly on the next flight. Right now, we just got back from the tax office where I was checked and billed. They said during the course of such a big project, I ought to be paying R8,961.91 ($1,099.00 USD) which is about R116,504.83 ($14,287.00) for thirteen months. The tax office is not a body I can negotiate with so I didn’t even try to tell them I will pay them once I clear my check because I don’t want any one else to know I have a check of such a huge amount. I am at the airport now thinking of moving back to the hotel room and explain things to them if they would allow me stay for the time being. I have my luggage but I don’t know if they would release my equipments to me. I asked if I could leave the equipments and then come back for it, they said that is not an option, the worst of it is that each day my equipments stays at the airport, I pay additional R350 ($42.7602 USD)."
illegitime,"Describe the perfect vacation you have had? It was way back flying to Paris with my daugmm, then taking a train through France, Switzerland, Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece. Then spending 1 month on Santorini a Greek Island together with my son. I had the time of my life, and these are my fondest memories. I will do it again."
illegitime,"Do you any tattoos and body piercings? I don't have any tattoo, but I do have my left ear pieced and some times I do wear earrings...lol Can you drive a vehicle? Do you have a car? I have 2 cars that I drive when I am back in town; I have a Benz G Class 2012 and a Mitsubishi Outlander 2012, but love to get a new one for myself and for you baby, because you happen to be the apple of my eyes and that I believe I will accomplish as soon as I finish my Contract"
illegitime,"Do you believe in true love? Yes, I do."
illegitime,"Do you believe that you have a good heart to care for people unconditionally? If you found a hundred dollar bill on the road and see a hungry orphan, would you feed him? If you get into an argument with me, and I pull you close to kiss you, would you still kiss me back? Would you love those close to me as I would love all those who matter to you? If I bring you breakfast to your bed would you kiss after saying thanks? Do you love to run away with me sometimes where we would be out of business environment to spend quality time together? Do you believe the world should concentrate more on peace projects than war funding?"
illegitime,Do you ever feel like something really great is about to happen? I kind of feel that way now.
illegitime,"Do you have a favorite musician in particular? Hmm, Don Williams is a nice artist who inspires me in terms of music for that he is my number one musician."
illegitime,"Do you have any favorite sport team you support in particular? Manchester United football club that’s my team, I love their pattern of playing when I am in town I love travelling going to watch their match together with my daughter."
illegitime,"Do you have faith that every man is the architect of his own destiny? Do you believe that Life without Love is like a harp without strings? Do you know that, You can’t make someone love you, all you can do is be someone who can be loved, the rest is up to the person to realize your worth? If God is the DJ, then Life is the dance floor; Love is the rhythm, and You might be my rythm? If you have said yes to all these and you say no to my next question then you might not really know what you want then (lol). WOULD YOU BE MINE TODAY , TOMORROW AND TILL END OF TIME? I know the possibility of thinking, this man I haven’t met, how can there be these feelings? What does he know about me? But I can tell you the truth about life. The people you have met and probably fallen in love with, what do they know about you that you think I don’t know? Probably, just some physical things, like smell, sense of touch, and body physics, and that is all. But these few things are the least things to love for. These are just sentimental values that are found in many at good length. The main things to love for are the abilities to agree on phenomena, and sense of directions. The unexplained attraction to someone’s words, which is life itself. These are the only things that matters deep down. How best can one get these things better than meeting in writings? Where you can escape the sentimental factors I mentioned earlier and once we meet, the biggest sentiments is there and one wouldn’t be able to help but start the feelings from there"

I want you to know that you mean so much to me. From the first day we found each other, we were determined to get to know one another. From that very moment, I knew it was you and we quickly grew on getting to know each other. I want you to know that every moment since that first day holds a special place in my heart. I was afraid at first that if I let you in I’d regret it, but I haven’t regretted a single moment. I trust you, and I know you’ll be there for me no matter what. I trust that you’ll be faithful to me and that you won’t hurt my heart."
illegitime,"Happy day to you my love, “Hi, Baby, I love you,” that’s always how we start. Those five simple words always bring a smile to my face and song to my heart. I am just writing this here because it’s the only way I know that I can shout to the world I love you! The day you came into my life a miracle happened. One minute I was resigned to the fact that love was a part of my past, something although painful to think about, was nothing more than mere memory. And then there you were. You opened my heart in ways it had never been opened before. You awakened a part of me that had lay dormant all of life. Although I had loved and been loved before, never had it been so intense and so deep as what we feel for each other. This much I am sure of, we share a love so true that I have never before experienced the true joy of complete empowering, soul-felt love as we share."

illegitime,"Hello , I am so happy to read from you and most importantly, to know we are both looking for the same thing in life. Where do I start from? Really, it is disturbing to go on that dating site to see how much people appreciate love, but yet, we have to go the extra mile to get this great status. I have a beautiful home in stockton,CA and seeks a beautiful angel, both inward and outward. Forgive my manners, my name is Ben Johnson, a global contractor.I own my construction company I deal basically in oil platforms, rig constructions, renovations, over water bridges, interior decors and some art works. Trust me, I can add to your beauty (lol). But I am really thinking of hanging the hat this year. Been through many ups and downs in life, yet, I am blessed in some other ways. I mean after getting to the top of success, I have come to realize that we are nothing without a partner. I mean someone who would stand by me no matter the situation. A woman who I can say, she alone has the right to be womanly irritating to me (lol). A witch who would protect me like a lioness would do her cub (lol). And I can promise to protect her beyond all vices. A woman who tells me, honey, you can do it, no matter what I want to do. I have really worked hard in the past 12 yrs to get to this height."
illegitime,Hello amazingness.
illegitime,"Hello Angel , I got your email and I am glad you did wrote. Your email means a lot to me. It shows how real and ready you are. I have been in NV for only one month as I used to own a house in Coral Springs, FL until something in me tells me its not my end point;"
illegitime,"Hello dear , thanks for the message i really enjoy reading from you and i will like to tell you more about myself I am the only child of my late parents Professor and Dr. Mrs of the blessed memory. I want to spend the rest of my life with someone who is friendly, honest, caring, and trustworthy and God fearing,. I find very much peace and tranquility here."
illegitime,"Hello dear, How has your day been? Nice to hear from you. I like to say much thanks for your message and for telling me more about yourself.

illegitime,"Hello Diamond, I got your message and looked at your picture over and over again, you are a true diamond, you are priceless, a blessing and an angel. Thank you for so much care. In 2004, two years after I lost my family, I moved to Coral Springs, Florida, because the house in New Berlin, NY where I used to live with my family, was becoming scary to me. Imagination of them still living in the house almost got me crazy. But I thank god I have overcome my fears, I am alive, full awaken again. Thank you for coming into my life at the very right time. I must say the days ahead would be very long ones as we are closing to the end of this big project. It is the biggest I ever had in my life, I signed a contract with this big company to execute a project of building their warehouses, offices and interior decor all around the globe of South Africa, even though I am to spend my own cash on this project, I am so happy that I’ll get three times the money I spend at the end of it all. So, to know I am close to finishing this, it’s a great joy in my heart. I could notice the joy of relief upfront on the faces of my men. Even the locals are beginning to admit that they will surely miss me. They say I have become more of a family (lol). I love all my men, be it professionals, acquired expatriate, and locals. While working I try to build a personal relationship with each and every one even though I have over 300 men on this location."
illegitime,"Hello how are you doing? hope your day has been nice? it's great to read from you again, i have been widowed for some years now ,Losing a love one is difficult but we have to move on in life .. I have been here at the camp for 18 months now and i should be retired or transferred from here in less than 3 months and this is why i want to make friends before i leave here it's easy for me when am out cause i don't have friends or relatives out there except my daughter"
illegitime,"Hello Wonderful Angel, I really appreciate this consistent communication and I would say it is a sign of WILL. And I tell you, wherever there is a WILL, there is a WIN. I appreciate every word in your response and I’m glad we both know exactly what we are looking for in life. Thank you so much for your condolence! Life is full of miseries and ironies, the most important thing is our willingness to stand to our challenges and wanting to move on with life once again. As it is said that winners never quit and quitters never win; I know we are winners. I believe we both know that Love is not a destination but a journey and this is a journey that takes two to walk. I mean two souls who understand ahead that they aren’t in for a kid walk, and what they have ahead is the most important mission in life; a place meant for true people. It is a place called joy and happiness paradise. Sweet Apple, I would also be stupid not to be a man of a woman like you. Really, I just see in your face that I can live with this woman, not the beauty part alone, but the depth"
illegitime,"Hello, bonjour, aloha, salut! (I wasn’t sure how to say hi, so I tried a bunch.)"
illegitime,"Hello. Also, you are amazing."
illegitime,"Here I am, heart and soul, confessing to the world how I feel about you. I would walk to the ends of the earth to meet you, and even though we are yet to meet, I already began the journey for love, for you, for us. Funny how love works in people’s lives. I sure never expected to neither meet nor find someone as amazing as you. You have touched my heart in so many ways and words couldn’t even begin to explain to you the love I feel for you. Without further making it harder on the two of us to be together, I need to tell you that I love you and I am here waiting and hoping a miracle happened for me to get on the plan. I have shed tears but they won’t put me on the flight. I have my fingers crossed, waiting and waiting. Dreaming of you always … I want you yesterday, now and forever. love you. Love always,"
illegitime,"here… We can hook up and hopefully, be wonderful soul mates… A little about myself. Hmmm, its no doubt I’m a very nice man and when people meet me, they sense it before long. I love epic movies cos I love adventure, stories of the ancient times and anything related to real life story. Family is what I cherish most in life cos family is it that holds the present, the future and generations to come; blood is certainly thicker than water… I love family a lot! The wise saying that “IF YOU CAN’T FLY, RUN; IF U CAN’T RUN, WALK; IF YOU CAN’T WALK, CRAWL; BY ALL MEANS, KEEP MOVING” seems the best saying in my world and that is why I never look back. Well, the only thing lagging in my life now is that lovely woman that will follow me to my dream land. I believe ‘ONLY THOSE WHO SEEKER, FIND’, and that is why I want to get to know you. I prefer direct email contact cos I don’t want to come on this site all the time. Kindly email me on my yahoo account at ‘benjohnson2244’ or leave your email address. Sometimes, we are dump-founded to answer love related matters cos love is beyond human thinking. It’s a natural thing from God Himself. Hope to hear from u asap. Cheers!"
illegitime,"Hey Beautiful, I just wanted to do something simple to say I love you and to put that smile I love so much back on your face. I want everyone to know how much you mean to me. Ever since you have entered my life, I've been flying on Cloud 9 and I have not come down yet.I miss you all the time. I can't bear to 'be' without you. Sometimes when we don't talk for long I find that painful, then when we do talk I find that painful too cos I know how much am gonna miss u when you leave."

Don’t get me wrong, I would love to hear your voice but I think it’s better we start this way. Looking forward to your swift response."
illegitime,"Hi my Queen how are you doing today and hope you are Good?,i miss you like never before yesterday and hope to hear from you soon,this is my dream for you Sweetie,I have to confess that i have had you in my fantasies when I have played with myself.

I hope you enjoy it and it makes you feel as wonderful as it does me. read it over and over when you need me close to you or when you are missing me. I love you, honey. Here it goes......"
illegitime,"Hi there, how are you?"
illegitime,Hi there. How’s life treating you today?
illegitime,"Hi Wonderful Angel, Precious Wife, Hello my angel. I write today to wake you up into yet another beautiful day. I don’t know how you have done this but I thank you for making me the happiest man I can ever be. I slept late last night as I was in bed thinking about our fantastic life together and also singing for you my love; yes, I agree that love could be crazy. That is why I believe that even though you were not physically with me in bed, your spirit, soul and mind are here with me. My love for you keeps growing with every morning sunrise and every night moon and all the moments in-between. I don’t know what I have done that I deserve a second chance. I lost one and yet I found another angel. How did I become so lucky. I trusted my instincts and got only you from that market and you turned gold. My instincts still direct me, move ahead with her in my journey. I really thank my God; I mean I ask for something good and he gives me the best (lol). Hiding from the whole past, rains and snow, for I may be reminded of some memories, trying to forget yet I wont let go."

That is pretty much all about me and hope to hear more from you soon."
illegitime,"Honestly, you have a very lovely profile and I wish I could just see your picture. There is this feeling that tells me you are as beautiful as your profile. Though what matters is the internal beauty but I would still like to see your picture. Kindly send me one to my gmail account at ‘biggoldenben’? I am interested in getting to know more about you. Cheers!"
illegitime,"hope to retire soon cause i want to be able to spend more time with my little girl and also have a family again "" complete family "" .. I have no siblings and same is Lisa so she is in a boarding school for now and all we have is each other .. Life hasn't been fair to us too over here."
illegitime,"How are you and i want to quickly write you a little about me before i go out....... am a Scottish man but based in US, and am a soldier by profession in Afghanistan for peace keeping mission .I have been with the Department Of deffence for 15 years now and now i'm a Sergant here. I lost my wife 2 years ago, and i have a beautiful daughter named Lisa and she is 4 and she is living and studying Edinburgh Scotland about 300 km of my house"
illegitime,"How are you doing my dear, how have you been? Thank you for writing me. I just got back from Johannesburg Hall of Johannesburg for the meeting. After a long day of discussion with the professionals who are to instal the electrical pipes at the deck of the building, they have given me a condition that has set my brain resonating for hours. This is the most critical part and the very last difficult stage of my project and I need only professionals to get this fixed. Like I told you before, it would take them three days, non stop, to get it all done. 12 people out of the total 25 professionals would be working from morning till very late at night while the remaining 13 people would resume at night and work till morning. Once they are done, the last stage is the fixing of the POP to cover the pipes and that would be done by the local labor I already have. It would take another three long days, non stop, to fix the POP so I have a total of only six days to complete this project. How I wish that could be the next six days. I’m in a shock as I write. I don’t know why these people, I mean every labor you can find here, love money more than any thing else. Yes, they are very good at what they do but life is not just about only money. One has to be considerate at times and have human sympathy. I hate to tell you that out of the $10million I brought here for this mighty project, I am having only $15k left with me and these people are charging $2k each for the 25 of them which makes a total of $50,000.00. I told them I would give them all the $15k I have left and pay them the remaining balance the very moment I get my payment because my agreement with the Abu Dahbi is to get my payment the same day I complete this project. I told them I would sign whatever paper they may want and gave them my word. We had this conversation for over four hours and when we were all too tired, we had shifted the meeting to tomorrow. They concluded today that I have to pay a minimum deposit of $40k and I can pay the remaining $10k at the end of six days."
illegitime,"How Are You Most Wonderful? Angel , Good morning wonderful one! How are you today? To be honest with you, my night was full of the thought about our life to begin.  So please tell me, who are you? A woman being a goddess? Or a goddess pretending to be a woman? Whichever you are, you are doing something special to me (lol). I mean after all these years, I would have thought I might not have the possibilities again of having my dream woman, my partner, my best friend and co-pilot."
illegitime,"How Are You My Sunshine, Hello my sunshine (LOL)! You must wonder why I call you sunshine. Can’t get the picture of you off my mind. I feel like giving a hug (lol). Just as the sun lights up the earth, you light up my life. The only one I have met, with a heart so bright. Just seems like yesterday, you came around my way, you changed my whole scene right away, with your outstanding personalty."
illegitime,"How Are You Queen Of My Heart? Hello my love,. How are you today? I must confess, I couldn’t sleep through the night. I felt like someone who has never been in love. All through my night, it was you I thought about. I talked to your picture because I have one right on my bed.  I kissed it and said I love you. I said so many things from one topic to the other as if I was talking to you for real. I played the song I sent to you previously and sang it over and over for your picture (lol). At a time, I knelt and prayed and thank God for bringing you into my life. I went to bed again hoping to get some sleep with your picture on my chest. Yet, eyes were just closed with minds opened just thinking about you. And before I know it, it was morning already. OMG! This has never happened to me in my whole life. Darling, you sure make me the happiest man I can ever be; thank you!"
illegitime,How do you feel when someone upset you? And what will you do to calm yourself down? I do feel unhappy for that moment; go to quite place and listening to a cool music that will calm me down.
illegitime,"How do you normally spend your leisure time? Listening to music, cuddling up reading a magazine or watching TV, cooking."
illegitime,How is your life over there ? do you like your job there ? i hope i can get to know you more though cause i hope to make honest friendship and more with you.. warm hugs to you.
illegitime,"How it Works Darling, good morning to you and thank you for the sweet message. This joy in me since we started writing one another, is the best I have felt so far in many years and I pray it grows and never die. I am at work already. How was your night? Like I told you earlier, whatever you need to know about me, just ask and I’ll honestly answer. I think you should know these as well. My mother is a French woman while my late dad is an American, born in New Berlin, NY. I was born in France but moved to the States the same year and at age 5, we lost dad and mom decided to move back to Paris because she couldn’t cope. My aunt who is also married to an American took me from mom and brought me up. They have a house in Cairo so we all stayed there as one family. Also, I spent my school life in Cairo; graduated from Cairo University as an Architect. But because she and her husband speak only English, I don’t understand my mother’s language till today. It bothers me at times but I promise mom to learn it in this life time. Probably, after this project is completed, since I won’t need to be working any more, I will enrol myself in a French class. I am the only child of my parents so I would say mom is the only person I have in my life and hopefully, you. My aunt was a great impact to my life but you know some people come to our life for a season. I think that was what god wanted her to do and that was fulfilled long time ago. I really can’t thank her enough! Mom said Aunt and family recently relocated to Australia. I do wish them well but haven’t heard from them in a long while. 35yrs ago, I moved to New Berlin, NY to start my career as an architect because I have faith in the God’s own country and I tell you what, I am successful! I met Mary in Paris but again in the States and we got married. Till the very moment she left this world, she was every thing in my life and I will never forget the good old days. Those days are what I am looking for once again. A woman that will be my life and every thing."
illegitime,"How long have you been using this platform? So tell me something, how are your experiences so far on Dating Websites been with Men Online I am new here, registered a week ago, and so far my experiences has been Terrible.

I am here because I know life is not all about me."" That is why I decided to join that site, because I am hoping to meet someone nice enough to share life's simple pleasures with.

Someone who has my best interest at heart because I will have hers. It would be great if I could talk to her about anything."
illegitime,"How many relationships have you been into before you came into online dating? I had three (3) deep relationships in my life; The first I had was when I was still a teenager with a girl named Amber, we were both attending the same school in London, she was from Milan, then we used to see each other everyday, helping one other with our assignment, unfortunately after our final exam at high school, she told me that her parents will be leaving London back to Milan and she was going with them also, I felt like wooh!!!, that means that you are going to leave me, she said she does not know what to do, so they left I was really unhappy during that period. The second was with my late wife and was my longest relationship, we were married for 17 years, I met her at my home town, Queens, New York. After her death I stayed a year and 5 months alone were I had a very special lady Named Ana; she was from Wyoming, I thought I was going to get married to her. We stayed 3 months together and I later found at that she was lieing and has been cheating on me, so I had to brake up with her and it hurts so much and so bad. Since then I have been single and I decided to come into online dating and find my soul mate."

illegitime,"How often do you like to go out; I mean going partying? I do not go out often that much ever since, I lost my late wife, because going out alone seems not enjoyable to me, so the few time that I go out must be with my kids and I will be looking forward to go out with that special lady someday."

illegitime,"I am being true to my feelings, as my old friend would say, never question if you are in love or not, because if you were you wouldn’t need to ask. So the best of men would accept what they feel without questions, because truly, Love and death cant be escaped, no one can tell when, how, or where. It is never too early or too late."
illegitime,"I am emailing you now because honestly, since I got back to the hotel room, I sat and prayed. My Goodness! You are the best woman any man can have. I know I will spend my whole life LOVING YOU, thanking you and appreciating you. If words could be made physical, I will make the most beautiful words for you my LO. A whole dictionary is not enough to say how wonderful you are. You are like the rainbow, only the lucky ones see you when you come out. I mean your kind are never common, only one in every million women."
illegitime,"I am on the South Dale in the coast of SA. Haven to wake up every morning by 6am to catch up my chopper down here. Working from then till late at night, yet being able to be distracted by this woman. I have over 300 labors here, both skilled and locals, yet all could notice a new glow on my face (LOL). Bishop Nelson and I have always stayed at Nelson’s in his CA home, he just got married almost two years now. He found his woman on the net and to be sincere, he inspired me. I am ready to travel any where and live any where in the world so far that would please my woman."
illegitime,"I am perplexed right now! I feel like I’m in a very wrong country!! I don’t know what to do!!! I shed tears but it won’t put me on the plane so I stopped. We have few hours to get together and this kind of thing is happening, dear, please call me, I need your sweet voice to calm down my heart before I develop high blood pressure. I want you to forget about this tax bill for now, let us put our minds off it and first get myself into the hotel room to have some hours sleep. It’s been a long day full of stress. Maybe when I wake up we can then talk and think of what to do. For now, I don’t want us to think of this because the rate at which it hurts could lead us into another bad situation. I just don’t want any of us to die of these stress because we still need each other for many more years. I love you so! Your Husband,"
illegitime,"I am really interested in wanting to know about what makes you the special person you are today, I want to know more about your family, your background, your life experiences, past relationships, your goals and dreams, your interests, and anything else you want to tell me. I even want to learn about the secrets you very rarely share with someone!. So come on and share it all with me, as I am not here to talk to you about general things such as partying, the weather, sports, e.t.c. I want to learn about you and what makes up your heart and soul, as the friendship I want to build with you I want it to be like no other you have ever shared in or experienced. This friendship I want to build with you will be filled with substance, quality, spirituality, love, faithfulness and potential. Hope I didn't write much of a novel Hope to hear from you soon. Until then have a pleasant day."
illegitime,"I am seeking for a long term relationship with Someone special to capture my heart and knows how to handle it with care, one who will cherish me,i am looking for someone to love as well, Capture my heart,Someone kind and affectionate and believe in romance...A real person, who likes themself and is comfortable with who they are, even if not where they are,i am seeking someone who can keep up with me, challenge me and inspire me. And who is intelligent, has ideas, may be creative and has needs and/or expectations to be fullfilled,I am looking for my soulmate to share lifes dreams with, someone who still believes in romance,fun,and is a true gentle woman at heart"
illegitime,"I am so happy we are both matured enough to understand what we need in life. Please do not blame my feelings! I don’t want to lie to you nor to myself so I urge you to be happy that you have a man who expresses himself just the way he feels rather than pretend or lie. The truth is, a journey of a thousand years start with a single step. The best we can do is what we are doing now and once I get to you, we can get married without any regrets. If you cannot know me now and love me for me, believe me, you will not love me when we are together. Love knows no bound and distance makes us know if truly we are in love or not. One can not wait till one meets a man or a woman before one decides to love one another cos if that is the only way it works, there won’t be dating sites. Let me make an illustration here perhaps it will help you hit the right point. When you meet a man who is handsome and you too look sexy and you both meet at a cafe or mall, without knowing any thing about each other, your minds jump and most of your decisions would be controlled by what your are seeing, I mean the handsome in him and your sexy look will make most of the decisions for both of you and before you even get to know one another, you are already making love and having sex and before long, you begin to know the person and in the end, he might never be the right man for you and you may not be the right woman for him. Then, it is already late to make some corrections, but all you can do is to say farewell to each other. That hurts I bet! But if you both meet in writing just like the real dating works, both of you have not seen each other apart from the pictures and if you can express yourselves and fall in love under such condition, then I promise that when you both meet, the main chemistry is already there and such relationship would last forever and ever. This is the reason I joined the dating site; to look for my own woman, my best friend, my own wife, my own love, my sweetheart, my co-pilot, my angel, my all and every thing, someone that will love me for me no matter the condition and she is sure to get more of equal love. I am so happy my heart is in for you and wants you for the rest of my days. I urge you not to lie to yourself as well. You had joined the dating site as a matured woman knowing fully well that a serious relationship has to be built first through writing and then you meet for the main chemistry. I really can’t wait to hold my woman’s hand, stand in front of a pastor and have him pronounce us as husband and wife. I want to live a proper life with my woman. I think we should really take this to another level. let me hear the voice of an angel. Be warned I have been told I have an unsorted accent, but sexy (lol). You can always kiss me on 01127781701978. lol Please write me first thing when you get my message, I’m waiting. I want you to tell me all you think I should know about you and if you still think there is something I haven’t told you, keep asking and I’ll always answer. With much love,"
illegitime,"I am so proud of you my love I know I will ever appreciate your kindness You are truly a light in the dark May the reward of God be with you Above all promises… Is my True love for you It is endless! On my life I swear…. The Sun goes away at night The Moon goes away in the morning Darkness and Brightness alternates But my love for you is still in all weather, condition and situation To go nowhere until the end of time."
illegitime,"I believe from that very moment we fell in love, we have become two bodies that dwell in only one single soul. Your smiles and your worries have become mine and so have mine become yours. I believe by now, even if the whole world would be against me or you, you and me only will comprehend and stand by each other. The path to success can never be walked alone but who do we walk with? Who could be there when it seems like hell was let loose upon us? Of course, our second half. It would take only death to separate one single soul. You are my love so understand what I mean here more than I have said it because really, there can never be any word to say exactly what I mean. Only powerful minds in love will understand this."
illegitime,I bet my dog would like you.
illegitime,"I can tell you that internet is the best and also the worst way of meeting people. It is the best in the sense that if two two people meet and are as open as a book with each other with no lies. I promise it cant fail. The worst in the sense that if these two meet and there is even a single atom of lie in-between, there comes disappointments, which is like a small stone that can bring down a big wall. Did you ever lie to me? Cos I wouldn’t ever lie for anything. My ma brought up a better man than that (LOL). Go and do the research about what I just said and you will find out whether the maths is good or not. As food is needed for the body, the same way love is needed for the soul. Food strengthens the body while love strengths the soul. A person is incomplete without love. I will never give up the fight and will of love"
illegitime,I can’t think of anything better than getting a reply from you.
illegitime,"I don’t flirt, but I will totally seduce you with my awkwardness."
illegitime,"I don’t want to go another day So I’m telling you exactly what is on my mind Seems like everybody is breaking up Throwing their love away I know I got a good thing right here That’s why I say (Hey) CHORUS: Nobody’s gonna love me better I’m must stick with you Forever Nobody’s gonna take me higher I’m must stick with you You know how to appreciate me I’m must stick with you My baby Nobody ever made me feel this way I’m must stick with you I don’t want to go another day So I’m telling you exactly what is on my mind See the way we ride In our private lives Ain’t nobody getting in between I want you to know that you’re the only one for me And I say CHORUS: Nobody gonna love me better I’m must stick with you Forever Nobody gonna take me higher I’m must stick with you You know how appreciate me I’m must stick with you My baby Nobody ever made me feel this way I’m must stick with you And man Ain’t nothing else I can need And man I’m singing ’cause you’re so, so into me I got you We’ll be making love endlessly I’m with you Baby, you’re with me So don’t you worry about People hanging around They ain’t bringing us down I know you and you know me And that’s all that counts So don’t you worry about People hanging around They ain’t bringing us down I know you and you know me And that’s why I say CHORUS: Nobody gonna love me better I’m must stick with you Forever Nobody gonna take me higher I’m must stick with you You know how appreciate me I’m must stick with you My baby Nobody ever made me feel this way I’m must stick with you GOOD NIGHT SWEETEST OF SOULS!!!"
illegitime,"I feel wonderful!!"" I kissed you, rolled on your side, pulled u close to myself, wrapped my arm around you, and we drifted off to sleep. We made love several more times during the night, softly waking each other up. Early the next morning, you slipped out of bed, and made breakfast. you brought me breakfast in bed. You kissed me awake. I had a smile on my face and said, ""Lets do that again""Baby, you don't know how many times since we meet dreams about us making love, different places, different times of the day, different positions. I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as i enjoyed playing it through my head and writing it down for you. This truly came from my heart with all the feelings that i feel for you. I love you baby and I'm looking forward to the day that we share everything together....................i cant wait to chat with you baby,i miss you and can`t wait to be with you....i love you more....."
illegitime,"I go for the inner beauty, it radiates and it speaks for itself over time and for a woman like you who is family oriented is an added advantage to me."
illegitime,"I guess you should truly know who I am. I don’t really know how this works but here is an exclusive. If at my age I do not know what I want and when to say it, then what would I be? When a wise man sees he has probably spent about half of his time in life already, he begins to assess his main goals in life. What could be more important than a happy ending? A man needs to live his life full of joy and happiness, no matter his achievements, he is reduced to nothing if he has no crown to complete him and that is a woman to call his own wife and best friend. A woman who knows that even while arguing they still need to hold hands. A woman whom I can call a partner in crime (lol). A woman whom you can tell anything and everything. How could you think anything can make you happier in life than finding a love that knows no bound. To make you know more about me, I will break this down into segments and it would be like a case study. If you ever had a French kiss, I bet you would be happy to know I have a French background; English is my second language so I have an accent. All my life, I have a story of only one woman to tell. And if I were told I would be on a dating site someday, I will never believe it. Sometimes in 2002, I lived happily with Mary, a wonderful angel; a wife any man would pray for and two blessed beautiful kids that stood as my shinning glory. But it is so sad to say they are no more! I hate to say this but I lost them in a fatal accident. I watched them lying dead in a pool of blood!!! As much as I adore my family, the inevitable death took them all in one day and life suddenly turned around my table of great joy into a terrible agony. Such is life! Sometimes we pass through situations we do not have control of and we only do nothing but bear whatever it is. I just want a woman who would be my best friend and everything. You know someone whom we would still love each other more as the days pass by, even when we cant make love anymore and all we could do is play bingo and lots more (lol)."
illegitime,"I have come to realize that, let a man write a better book, let him preach a better sermon, let him sing the best of songs, let him gain wealth beyond dreams, he is reduced to nothing except he has a woman to call, my wife, my best friend and co-pilot. My usual saying, and I am known for it, is that, ‘life is simple for those who take it simple’. I don’t like to complicate things, there is joy in every situation if you know the right angle to look it from. My mother is very old now and at almost 91, she can still sing. Now she cant wait to have me come visit her in Paris with my second half, and I cant wait to have a happy home too. After my last project here in Johannesburg, SA, I am quitting field works (in only three weeks time). Any other job would only require my attention from my home office wherever I go. I want to spend the remaining seconds of my life with my woman. I have a house in the States,I have one in Dubai, but if life turns around and I have no home any more, are you the type that will stand by your man to build one? Would you smile at your man when he looks tense? I don’t need a super model, I rather need a very good friend who knows when I am tensed just by looking into my eyes and a super woman. The whole world may be mad at me, but if my woman is smiling at me, I would care less. Who says we cant pick rags and turn to riches? Who says we cant design our own paradise together. It is workable just walk by my side, please send me more pictures of your beautiful self. Here is a song (http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=EXRUoyaauw) specially for you, please listen to it with your heart, body and soul. Every word in it is a dedication to you. Looking forward to your email. Still smiling!"
illegitime,I have prayed last night and again this morning —I asked God and Archangel Michael to surround you- your work -your house and family with 65 million Angels to protect and guide you. Stop and take a moment to visualize this honey – – wall to wall Angels everywhere –just for YOU. You are so very awesome honey -do you know that ? You are sweet -kind-generous -loving-adorable -brilliant-intelligent-funny
illegitime,"I have seen faces of women on that site, many of whom have been taken for granted, many of whom are not being reciprocated, but I have come with a good news and a bad news. The good news is, I am here to pick my woman to make happy, my second half, my best friend, my co-pilot, but the bad news is, I have only one woman to do this for (lol). I saw something in your face, something that made my heart pause to read you, something that tickles in the heart, could that be love at first sight? Maybe we could find that out (lol). I’m talking about faith here cos when feelings are so powerful, it’s as if some forces beyond your control are guiding you to someone who can make you happy beyond your wildest dreams. I hope we can now have a direct communication via email cos I do not want to go on a dating site ever again."
illegitime,"I hope we can be in constant communication so we can get to know more about ourselves. What's your plan for the future dear? All i want now is someone who i can love and give my heart to, honest, faithful and responsible. A woman who can communicate what she desires and has the ability to listen. Someone who is positive and believes that everyday holds something amazing. I want to share my life with someone, and it won't be as a playmate. I am a very passionate man, and i need a passionate woman to be my partner.i have got to know the value of a woman in a man's life. And also to let you know that the distance and language can never be a problem because all that matters is understanding, trust and passion as i am ready to travel miles just to spend the rest of my life time with the woman i love.Hope you find this mail understanding."
illegitime,"I HOPE YOU KNOW Sweetest of souls, Good morning to you sweetest of souls. What a heart taking message to wake up to. You simply grabed me by the head and I felt your kiss (lol). Been thinking about you most of my night / day and I don’t ever want to stop. I will find time to call you today. Oh! You brought tears of joy to my eyes, I was totally moved by your message. Thank you for being you …….!"
illegitime,I hope you’re having a nice day ??
illegitime,I hope your days are good. Our meeting would be starting at exactly 2:00 p.m this afternoon so I’ll get in touch with you after the meeting. Pls keep me updated with events around you. You are always on my mind. Wish I could hear your voice. Hugs and kisses!
illegitime,I just had to say hi to you. Hi!
illegitime,"I keep thinking of how much I need to be home with you, how much I want us to be together and how much I want to be with you every where and any where. Darling, I will be kissing you every morning and make passionate love to you in bed and maybe in the shower too; I hope these are things you would like. Our afternoons and evenings would be filled with so much fun, laughter, smiles, dance, talk, walk, relax, kiss, hug, and many more. Our nights would be you on me and me on you, even when we sleep, we would still be holding hands. And I love my tongue for it tickles, I will start from your head and slip gently down and in to every single part of your body and you could almost loose your breath. Your loud scream would be a trigger and makes me more perfect. My love, I am here fully emotional and just want to be with you. Oh my, how I wish I could grow wings, I would be with you before the early morning sun rise, land at your window and gather the whole birds in the world to join me sing this to you (http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=Kzdekl3Qj8c). I am sunk in love, crazy about you honey. I am at work but I can hardly leave the office cos I am waiting to hear from you every second of every minute of every hour. Please tell me, what have you done to me? (lol)… I love you sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooo much ….. and I’m so happy that you are the one for me. I just want to be on my way to you. This is what I have wanted for years and I can’t wait any more. Kisses and hugs!"
illegitime,"I kind of, sort of, well, pretty much think you seem amazing. Want to chat sometime?"
illegitime,i know that this might be too forward or fast but i just thought you knew what i felt and i am sorry if this is not want you wanted.I pray and hope that you understand my message ....
illegitime,"I know this question can be out of the line... lol Lets say If you could wake up tomorrow with any superpower, what would it be? Hmm, that would be the power of Clark Kent also known as superman, I want to be the one to save the day."
illegitime,"I know you believe that good things come to those who wait, but my wonder is … why does it take so long for those good things to arrive, and why does the wait have to come with all these obstacles of hard and testing times? All I have right now are my dreams of you, so I will close now to dream of us, and wait for that precious tomorrow when I can wake up to my dream come true — YOU!! Stay strong, and I will always love you, and I will wait as long as it takes. Because my love for you won’t change in a year – or – twenty, not even a life time. It is you and me, Jo-Ann, forever. Thank you for loving me; I have never truly lived until the day I received your love. I just can’t wait until I get the chance to live again, so please take good care of yourself. I love you always. Love always, Ben Gold"
illegitime,"I laid you down on the bed, continuing to suck your nipples and my hands were touching ur skin. I worked my way down to ur panties and slid them off. . you began moaning my name""Please Roland, take me. Take me now!!"" ""No my love, not yet"", I said to you. ""Its been a long time for us both, I want us to enjoy this"". I put my knee between ur legs. u opened ur legs freely. Then I lowered my mouth to u and began to suck your Pussy. I thought you were going to explode. I heard you say ""Come on baby, !"" as I suck ur pussy, you pushed my finger up in side of you. That was it......""Oh my god!!!! You came so wet. I could feel you climaxing around my finger. ""Thats it baby, u said, Now its time"" u came close to me on ur knees and rubbed the end of myself up and down against my Cock. I was teasing you again. you kept trying to capture me and push down. you wanted me deep in side of you.I would only let u have a little of me at a time, then I would pull out. It was you that was begging this time. ""Please baby, I need you. I have got to have you NOW!!!"" I finally gave in myself, I couldn't take it any more either."
illegitime,I like how your nose is in the middle of your face. That’s really cute.
illegitime,I like hugs.
illegitime,I like it when a guy/girl talks nerdy to me.
illegitime,"I love the fact that I get these much emails from you. I feel special. Trust me, I am a warrior. What a wonderful way of life it is to find joy and happiness in someone else. I would ask you some few questions which requires a min before you answer each. I think it’s time we hold hands and kiss and say to one another all those little things that makes one head want to blow off. As far as I know, this is our destiny and we cannot deny it. So right now as you read this, I am holding you and kissing you; I am asking these questions and you are saying the answers directly into my ears. Do you believe in Love, even amidst this crazy world we find ourselves in? Do you believe that happiness has value more than every material things we may get in life?"
illegitime,"I love to cook and play video games with my mother and sometimes we swim at the pool in the evening.....and sometimes we ride on our four wheeler..I am a channel surfer,I like csi any cit discovery,tlc anything that has to do with motorcycles.I also like a few reality shows, american idol so you thing you can dance the news sometimes.anything funny or something that will atleast make me smile.

Some of my favorite musicians songs are Chris Tomlin, Dave MatthewsRobert Kelly and Eminem...i have only been in relationship with Danielle she is dead, i love and she loves me too i really miss her..."
illegitime,"I love you so! http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=D8ZOJj5ni44 “If That’s What It Takes” You’re the bravest of hearts, you’re the strongest of souls You’re my light in the dark, you’re the place I call home You can say it’s all right, but I know that you’re breaking up inside I see it in your eyes Even you face the night afraid and alone That’s why I’ll be there When the storm rises up, when the shadows descend Ev’ry beat of my heart, ev’ry day without end Ev’ry second I live, that’s the promise I make Baby, that’s what I’ll give, if that’s what it takes If that’s what it takes"
illegitime,"I love you, babe. You are my now and ever, my only love, and I thank you for being so kind with my heart. Hopefully, in some hours to come, I won’t have to hate missing you. The inspection team of Abu Dahbi are out there waiting for me and I am going to join them now. I will email you again after every thing, to celebrate this great success together. Love Always, Your Mr. Gold."
illegitime,"I love thinking of you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Every day I wake up thanking God for you. You have given me so much, and I know I will be able to give back all that you have given me. You have been my guiding light when I was lost. You have been my comforter through all my trials and sorrow. You have been my rock."
illegitime,"I MUST STICK WITH YOU FOREVER SWEETHEART, IT’S THE 1:20 P.M HERE AND I CAN’T BREATH. WHAT EXACTLY AM I DOING? I AM THINKING ABOUT YOU!!! HONESTYLY, I AM THE LUCKIEST MAN ON EARTH. YOU ARE WORTH ALL OTHER 999BILLION WOMEN ON THIS PLANET. BABY, YOU MEAN MORE THAN LIFE TO ME. BELOW IS ALL I CAN SAY TO REACH DOWN YOUR HEART. I MUST STICK WITH YOU FOREVER AND EVER.http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=-ZlajjbX94g"
illegitime,I passed by your photo too many times not to stop a say hi.
illegitime,"I reached for ur breasts, feeling ur large hard nipples. You could tell that you were on the edge of having an orgasm and I pulled away from u. Stood up, extending my hands to you, helping you up. We walked into the house to the bedroom. Without turning on the lights, I shut the door, turned to you and began kissing you again. I were making your head spin. I moved down to ur neck, then reached down and pulled your dress up over your head. Kissing ur shoulders, I reached around u and released your bra, dropping it to the floor. I kissed and licked my way to ur breasts one at a time, while I were walking u backwards to the bed. The minute I took ur nipples in my mouth, You felt like You were going to fall to the ground. your legs tuned to the door.It felt so good. Oh my god.....You were so wet."
illegitime,"I tell you this everyday, but you are the most beautiful person I know, inside and out and I see that more clearly with each passing day. I love everything about you, about us. You do something to me that no other has, you have made me so happy, the happiest I've ever been. You give me the most amazing feelings inside, the feeling of being in love with you. I still don't know what I did to be so lucky to have you in my life, my dream come true... I am so thankful though. In this short time that we've been together, we have grown so much and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. Am falling in love with you barbara, with all my heart and soul, always and forever!"
illegitime,I tend to wear my heart on my profile. ??
illegitime,I think I quite fancy you.
illegitime,I want this message to be the reason you smile at your screen.
illegitime,I want to be the reason you look into your phone and smile.
illegitime,"I want to close my eyes and feel your breath; I want to fill those spaces in between your fingers; I want to travel to the sky and the moon and the planets and watch you fly with the real angels in wings; I want to walk beside you, not behind nor in front of you; darling, I want to sit down with you, put your leg on my laps and gently move my hand in and out of your leg to the extremes and watch you close your eyes and mourn. I am dieing right here cos I can’t wait to be with you. Will talk to you later today. Love you more and more. Your Gold!"
illegitime,I want to say that my heart is full of joy and happiness for knowing you and i will like us to keep this closeness and hope this will bring us to a better future as I wish. We seriously need people's prayer for God's protections here in Afghanistan. Hope to hear from you soon. Do have a nice day.
illegitime,"I wanted to feel all of you against my back side. you continued to moan softly, calling me by name. ""Please baby, you said, you want me so bad"". you turned yourself around to face me. I took your face in my hands and began kissing u softly. The passion grew and our kisses became more intense. You put your hands on my chest, feeling me through my Shirt. you found one nipple......then the other."
illegitime,I was more excited to see your profile photo than pizza. And I really like pizza.
illegitime,"I was so easy. I started touching your neck, then I ran my fingers down your shoulders and your arms. I slid my hands under ur arms to ur chest. your nipples became hard. you could feel my body responding. I began kissing the back of ur neck. You softly moaned, holding my warm hand to by breast as I moved back closer to you."
illegitime,I will always tell you when you have something in your teeth. That’s just the kind of person I am.
illegitime,"I will be out of the door straight to the bank soon. I attached the copy of my check to this email and you already have my flight confirmation. Please remember this check is a secret I will never share with any one else so please keep it to yourself. Flight is scheduled to take off at ……PM today while we arrive tomorrow at …..PM. My luggage is packed and the truck man is set to take my equipments to the airport. Once I’m done at the bank, I will be going to the agent to pay him and get my ticket. I will also have enough money to pay the taxi man, the truck man and my deficit at the hotel. You don’t know how happy I am right now. I don’t even know the best way to express my feelings. I believe you know this kind of joy I’m talking about."
illegitime,"I will lay down my heart, my body, my soul I will hold on all night and never let go Ev’ry second I live, that’s the promise I make Baby, that’s what I’ll give, if that’s what it takes If that’s what it takes Every day If that’s what it takes Every day I’ll love you forever and ever ….."
illegitime,"I will sit in front of you as you watch me cares you and tell you sweet words from my innermost heart. This is the way I want to live for the rest of my life, to be happy with my hobby, with you. I also love that fact that both you and I will retire and do nothing but enjoy and celebrate each moment of our lives together. Have you thought of where in the world you want us to live? I want you alone to make that decision because honestly, wherever you will be happy is where I want to live for the rest of my life"
illegitime,"I wish I could tell you but I don't want to scare you away from me, and I would rather write you and not be with you then to never see you , because writing you every day is a gift from God that I was blessed with. I guess I will never know how you feel unless I confess my love to you. Who knows - you might feel the same about me. I really think I am falling in love with you . I just don't know how to tell you."
illegitime,"I wish you were here to see how excited i am to received your message, i really felt so good. You are such a nice beautiful woman whom i would like to get to know .. Well, i am just a very caring man and i do really like kids alot because they are God gift from the heaven so parents are to do anything to make them happy and be a very good child,i hope you won`t bother about the distance between us, distance does not matter in a relationship, what really matter most is the HEART and FEELINGS and distance is only there for us to get toknow each other much better before getting to meet each other in person then see how things develop. Well, i really would like to get to know you more and sometimes chat with you then see how things may work out. "
illegitime,"I would still not find the main reason… I believe in the saying that true love is unconditional, it doesn’t ask why… it knows no bound nor distance… it just captures the mind and you find yourself in it… the truth is, THE FEELINGS I HAVE, MY EMOTIONS, THE PASSION IN ME IS UNCONDITIONAL… I’LL BE LOVING YOU FOR YOU AND WITH EVERY SECOND TIME MOVES UNTIL THE END OF TIME… Please take care of yourself sweetest of souls~ I already told my ticketing agent to book my flight so I don’t miss a seat. Once I have the confirmation from him, I will forward it to you. I will call you when I wake up. Your VE (lol)."
illegitime,"I wouldn’t be scared anyway, because truly, love is not about finding the right person, but creating a right relationship. It’s not about how much love you have in the beginning but how much love you build till the end. The inevitable truth is, if it is meant to be, our hearts will find each other regardless of the distance apart. And if our hearts melt together so will our bodies and souls. Then every word and every touch will fuel our passion flame. I will be yours, you will be mine, and we will be one, forever and ever."
illegitime,"I want to lie next to you at night and fall asleep in your arms. I want to wake to your beautiful smile. I want to share in your joys and sorrows. I want to be your everything, because you are everything to me. I promise to always love you and always hold you in my heart. I will always be there for you when you need me, and I will love you no matter what life brings us. You are my soul mate, and I vow to love you all eternity. I love you, babe. I am going now to the Embassy and the Tax office, wish me well honey. I will get in touch with you when I get back. Please take good care of yourself for me and thank you for every thing. Yours,"
illegitime,"I`m athletic build, mentally stable, physically fit, a bunch of laughs, warm, caring, honest, a good listener, God Fearing, and a positive person. I am real easy person to talk to and a loving and outgoing father. I enjoy playing sax which i do often at my leisure time. I like going to the movies, or watching movies in my room or Cabin, I like swimming, listening to music, watching football and I am a diehard fan of Chelsea FC and dance to any kind of music, I sing, sailing, going bowling and also a good cook. I am a family oriented person, love children and there is more, but it would be better for you to find some things out for yourself."
illegitime,I’d love to talk to you. For reals. No fakesies.
illegitime,I’m looking for someone I can be a complete nerd with. You interested?
illegitime,I’m the good kind of weird. How about you?
illegitime,I’m willing to risk the cooties if you are.
illegitime,"I'd rather turn my back on all that drama than live a miserable life. I am not bitter about any past relationships and do not believe in bringing them into a new one What makes you laugh, smile, and cry???? Crazy funny people. Sarcastic people like Dr Cox on Scrubs. I love his character. I love intelligent comedy like political satire. I love Robin Williams, Jim Carey and Mike Myers. They crack me up so much. I love watching those home video clips of kids doing hilarious funny things. Kids make me laugh. The things they say. You never expect it.What makes me cry, I'm always moved when i see scenes on tv between parent and child when they are struggling or dealing with the relationship. my personality type tends toward being outgoing. People would most often describe me energetic, loving,caring, extremely emotional, bubbly, understanding, very supportive, very caring and warm, very passionate and loving,i dont drink nor smoke,i am not into any kind of drugs as well,i like to hang out and have nice time with my partner,I love to bowl, though I haven't done it in years and shoot pool, play cards, just cruise on a beautiful sunny day,I love the water and one day hope to be blessed to have a home on the water."
illegitime,"If someone doesn't have the respect to be faithful to the one they are with, than get rid of them first. There are no excuses for cheating!I believe that just because I think I'm right, doesn't necessarily make the other person wrong.. Being mean and name calling isn't part of my life.. "
illegitime,"IF THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES! Good morning my love. I think the song below and the lyrics says my way of waking you up today, into a world of solid promises. I am here in the office thinking of nothing but you my dearest. I am missing you more than I can explain. I place eyes on the clock and keep watching as it moves. There is nothing I want more, all I want is to be on the flight taking me to you. Play the song, read the lyrics and open your heart, you will find me holding your hands and looking straight into your bewitching eyes. "
illegitime,If you are at a loose end what are some of the following things you do? I will have hope and never to give up.
illegitime,"If you are found guilty of a crime, would you admit yourself and accept your mistakes? I will admit my self, accept my mistakes, and face the consequences, because I am a God fearing man, and I do abide to the truth."
illegitime,"If you could change something about yourself, what would it be & why? I would change how I tend to dwell on the past, because it's really dragging me down lately. Our experiences in life made us who we are. No one is free from difficult times in life or what some may call baggage. How you've dealt with those experiences will determine if you're damaged or resilient. I'm a prime example of resilient and not looking to do damage control. I understand everyone has old baggage, but I want someone who has put the old baggage up for old memories and is ready to create new memories. Life is short and you never know about tomorrow, so if you want to live life ""like there is no tomorrow."
illegitime,"If you respond to one message today, let it be mine."
illegitime,"If you see somebody you don't know who needs help, would you be of any support? Yes I would help in anyway, because God in heaven says it is good to help those that are in need and he loves a cheerful giver. I think it's important to have compassion for others in need of help. I have a good and caring heart. I don't like arrogance or to be selfish. It's the strangest thing, but kindness attracts kindness, like whenever I see someone’s car got broke down, I always love to help and assist that person, because when mine also gets broke down or I had a flat tire someone always has come to my rescue."
illegitime,"If you wanted to talk, it’d definitely make my day… or maybe year."
illegitime,"I'm honest, faithful, caring, respectful, responsible and witty. I like having fun and laughing.I like most kinds of music, except rap. I also like to sing karaoke for fun. Other interests include drawing, writing poetry, reading, art, museums,concerts, camping, hunting and fishing. I don't watch much TV, but I do like a good happy ending movie now and then, (but not at a walk in theater).I don't mind getting my hands dirty and do a lot of yardwork and remodeling myself. Will even help work on cars. I don't care for sports much, but don't mind if a woman likes them if it doesn't take much time away from us I don't like head games, lying, cheating, abusers or fighting. I don't like being around people who are drug users and those who make a habit of getting drunk."
illegitime,"In 2004, same year I moved to FL, I worked at the oil rig of Dubai and after the project, I had the opportunity to own a home in the city resulting from the cheap sale from the first owner who intends to relocate to India where he came from. It was a chance I couldn’t miss so I grabbed it. I paid only half of the money while the remaining half is to be paid to the Government."
illegitime,"In a relationship how do you see a situation whereby the woman earns more money than the man? A good relationship where two lovers understand each other, they're concerned for each other and they respect one another, I don’t think that there will be problem about that, to me is no problem as far as they both love their selves."
illegitime,"It has not been but a short time of getting to know one another and we are totally crazy about the other. I asked you if you believed in soul mates and you said that you believed that God does make a special someone from every man. Whether that man finds that someone he was created for or not, I know I was created for you."
illegitime,"It is very important for me to build a life of stability, security, and opportunity for the special person I hope to share my thoughts, feelings, experiences, dreams and fantasies with, and to offer the best opportunities for any kid that might be included in my life, both mine and  that special person children, and that is my focus at this time and I also do enjoy my job though risky because we are always on the high battle field."
illegitime,Just saying hi. Because I’m annoying like that.
illegitime,Just stopping by to say hello. Hello!
illegitime,Just wanted to say hi!
illegitime,"Just you may wish to know, I attached some pictures of a big project of one of the leaders of the people I am working for; the Abu Dahbi’s. Any one could think it is a hotel but no, it is a house. We built the house for Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the former ruler of Abu Dahbi. I was part of this huge project, worked on the bathrooms and toilets. We built the house 5yrs ago. The last two pictures is an Audi A8 car, made out of pure silver for one of the Sheikhs. These people are extremely rich and pay a lot but they don’t pay deposit especially on big projects. Like I told you before, they will pay three times the money invested after the project. I really can’t wait to finish this project and be with you honey. I want to give you things you never dreamed of."
illegitime,"Last night, I did had a dream of us and it was so sweet. I never wanted to wake up cos we were having a wonderful time; I see clearly that we were in the house running and dancing and singing together and suddenly, our bodies melt together and before long, we made sweet love. Oh my, I cum three times in my dream and I was rolling in bed saying ‘darling, let me go clean up’ but when I opened my eyes, oh, I was so touched and wish there is something that could just fly me to you. Darling, loneliness is not good and I really want you. I want you with me honey; I want you all the time; I want you every now and then; I want to sleep in bed and feel your body close to mine; I want to sing and watch you dance to my voice;"
illegitime,"Let me give you a name today. Look at these four letters word, L O V E. They are the best combination of letters known to mankind. If we divide the letters into two places, we have, LO and VE. Without LO, VE is useless and without VE, LO is meaningless. Yet, LO+VE=LOVE. Today, I choose to be your VE while you mean my LO (lol). Without us together, we are certainly incomplete. I hope you love your new name, LO (lol). Will write more later today. Your Husband,"
illegitime,"Life is boring if perfect. Life is worse when there is nothing to change about anything. The balance in life is based on the facts that, there must be thieves and criminals for the police to remain employed. The medical practitioners would run out of business if we are all hale and hearty. The legal practitioners would die of boredom if there aren’t offenders. If everyone are vegetarians, Oh my! Guess how many people would not earn a living."
illegitime,"Listening to my body, soul, mind, heart and spirit, it is you I want. Not just for a period but for ever and ever. Back into our pasts, we gave in all but still, look at where we are today. Still on the same road like someone in a circular path, always returning to the same point; looking for our second half. Why not hold hands and just walk straight. And to be candid, there are three major attributes of true love, of every good relationship that lasts forever. Those attributes are what we need to put into great consideration. They are understanding, tolerance and endurance. Every wonderful partners that live together until their dieing days must have passed through a lot, I mean, they must have been through some really hard time. But because they understand themselves, tolerate one another and endure whatever situation they find themselves, their life seems magical as if they have special bond holding them together. And every relationship that ever crashed surely lack those attributes either from one of the partners or both of them. I know at this point of our lives, we are no longer kids, I don’t think we would have any reason to break one’s heart. In my past, I have never done that and you didn’t also, you can see we are good people meeting at the best time of our lives."
illegitime,"Many people spend so much time thinking they can create love. NO! That is impossible but only a waste of time. If truly, love can be created by mankind, we won’t have any broken heart. Every relationship that takes long before the partners fall in love will have a happy end. But nah, most love life people spend time building often end in tragedy. To be candid, which love are we building? A duplex or a mansion or a small room? Very funny! Or has any one ever seen love physically? lol. It’s not human created phenomenon, its like a spirit, it enters into those who submit to it. We all need to start seeing the other side of the coin because it is the side facing down, only powerful minds can see it."
illegitime,"Marriage they say ""Is For Better, For Worse"" do you believe in this principle? Yes, I do believe in that, because that is where you have to show that you love your partner very much."
illegitime,"Morning My Love Oh my love, good morning to you. I have been thinking about you all day long. You are sure the keeper of my star, wiper of my tears, carer of my soul, joy of my life, taker of my breath, reader of my mind, melter of my heart, lover of my world, reason for my living, hearer of my worries, bringer of my smiles, angel of my spirit, cover of my body, filler of all spaces, sweetest of souls. It is truly no accident finding you, god had a hand in it, long before I knew you. I love you forever. Thank you so much for being you. I hope this song (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3ZEekN2hfE) explains more of what I can say to you right now. Your Golden man,"
illegitime,My atoms are attracted to your atoms. It’s chemistry.
illegitime,"My Co-Pilot Dear Co-pilot, My dearest love, thank you so much for all the lovely messages. They always make me look down my heart and see you there. Today I sat and thought, with every breath I took, of only you. I remember when we first found each other like it was yesterday. Two people in two different worlds, 9 long years that I lost my family and was all alone, not knowing what life had in store for me. And then an opening of the door and there you stand, a woman with a heart the size of the heavens above. One day lead to the next, and then days turned into weeks and and so did our love grow and keep growing, we made a family."
illegitime,"My forever one, I think the best is to put this into writing. At exactly 10.30 a.m today, I was in the bank with my check and joined the short queue. I know the amount is too big to cash on the counter but I needed to give it a try to know their procedure and if they would just cash out some of the money for me and put the remaining into an account I would also be able to operate when I return to the States. I was dressed in my collar shirt, well ironed to leave attractive gators and my pant trouser. I tried like never before to look so cool like someone who is about to get married (lol). And really, I am, to you, …… (lol). I mean I felt so relaxed and confident remembering how much I have on my check. I have never made up to this amount in my whole life. Please my love, I will never share the copy of my check with any one in this world. Only you and me know about it so please do not show it to any one. I trust you with all my life and I know you will never disappoint me."
illegitime,"My love for you is in no doubt unconditional; because I don’t have a particular condition for loving you. If I say its the way you talk on phone or your gorgeous voice or the way you put your words in writing or the way you look so beautiful in the picture or your strong faith in God, love and life or the way my mind beats for love each time I get to contact you or the way I feel about you right from the very moment I get to find you or the stories we shared about our past or the truthfulness in your words and readiness to love and be loved once again or the age that shows we are old enough to know what we want or every thing about you…"
illegitime,"My love, here I come on my kneels, I will never ask you any thing if I have other options. Though you come first but I hate to take my woman through stress. Here is our trial time honey, we should be one all through the thick and thin of life. We will have a good testimony to tell in only six days once I have the complete money and let these professionals resume work. One thing you must have in mind is, I will refund all your money the same day I get over. My appreciation to every one will last forever but most of all, my greatest appreciation will always be yours, I love you. All I need is $3k but even if you can’t help with every thing, I will be grateful for whatever you can afford to loan me for now. Please, I beg you honey, I just can’t afford to have this job delayed despite my long hard work."
illegitime,"My love, Good day to you and thanks for every thing. It is yet another long day with every one very busy. How is your day going? I hope every thing is fine and you are working less cos I’m getting real close to the end of this project and about time to get my ass on flight to you. Darling, the sets of POP needed for roofing arrived today from China and every thing went well with the installation of the electric pipes going fast. Oh, thanks to God, we are getting things exactly as planed and will be done as planed"
illegitime,"My mother would really love to meet you …….. and I hope we can go see her before she pass away. She’s old and I fear she doesn’t pass away till she sees me again with my woman. I am so …… now honey, I’ll email you again first thing when I ………. Please take good care of yourself and remember Ben cares. Each time I think about you, a star falls from the sky; so if you look outside your window today and see no star, its all your fault for you made me think about you too much. Now I have your picture in my wallet, another one on my bed, another one in the bathroom and another one in my heart. I want you around me every where and any where. Please take it easy with work and take good care of yourself. Yours Forever,"
illegitime,"My Soul My soul, good morning to a beautiful world and thank you for the lovely message to wake up to. Yes, the interior decorations will be completed this week and then we can proceed to fixing of the electrical pipes and covering of the pipes. All those will take only six days once we are through with the interior decoration and I am getting paid the same day.  I have invested all I had in this project but the good news is, once I am done, I will be three times richer than I was (lol). I will explain more to you when I call today."
illegitime,"My world, we would have so much to plan as soon as we get together. My dream has always been to travel to all the beautiful places in the world with my woman and with you, that dream will come true. And you will love it for I find humor in almost every thing no matter the situation. I can turn tears into endless laughter and bring smile to a sad face. I am gifted in making people happy. I want a woman to love and to love me now and forever."
illegitime,"MY, OH MY! My love, you have sent me the best message I have ever received in my whole life. How wonderful it is to know our love is reciprocal. You see honey, we will be spending the rest of our lives together in great joy and fulfillment of heart. We will be together TILL DEATH DO US PART. You are making me more than happy and really, I can not write enough of how much I feel now until later today because I should be staying with the workers all through the day as this is the last day of the interior decorations. I LOVE YOU MORE THAN LIFE …… PLEASE WHEN YOU WAKE UP, PLACE YOUR RIGHT HAND OVER YOUR LEFT SHOULDER AND YOUR LEFT HAND OVER YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER, THAT IS ME GIVING YOU THE BIGGEST HUG EVER. ALSO CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BLOW A KISS TO THE AIR, THAT IS ME RECEIVING A KISS FROM YOU. I LOVE YOU MY WIFE."
illegitime,"Now, lets talk about True Love: In my own word, true love is a natural phenomenon… its from God himself… one can not build true love like trust… love built by humans soon collapse… true love is so powerful, so strong, so uncontrollable and that is why you hear some say it is blind… true love can capture any body at any time and make even the saddest man a fool for love… true love is unconditional, it doesn’t ask why?… true love understands, it tolerates and endures… true love never dies, it never fades, it gets stronger with every morning sun shine and every night moon… true love does not warn ahead… many have fallen in love the very first day they met and get married and yet live happily for the rest of their lives… and many have dated for many years thinking they can build true love like trust and in the end, they brake up seconds after wedding… so true love is god’s will and comes to those who believe in it… true love is all about how well and never how far… no matter the distance there-is between two lovers, the love yet grow stronger… true love is joy and happiness, a certain kind of sharing that holds two hearts together in tenderness and caring… true love is the love that lives even after death… the love for our dead is another type of true love and that is why we remember all the time and pray for them… even though some dead are gone for thousand years, their living families remember them like they left yesterday… but despite all the wonderful nature of true love, it has a bitter side that makes the world feel it does not exist any longer… true love is often not reciprocal… that we love someone does not always mean they love us back… that is such a painful nature of true love… yet true love can reciprocate… when true love is reciprocal, such lovers live together and never let go… those are kind of few marriages that survive in our universe today… the kind of marriage I want with you. Could you tell me your ideology about true love and life? Looking forward to your sweet self. Hugs!"
illegitime,"of your soul. As I could remember, as a kid, I was a very cute one (lol). One whom many bullies would target, but only to realize there is a tough side of me. I could make a sober person dance; I could affect one with my smile. I grew up having more older friends. Many would confide in me. To tell you, I am a type that doesn’t judge. No matter how dirty you may be, just come to me, and I will give my support. There is no Mr Right until we make him right and there is no Mrs Right until we make her right. A relationship is never about how much at the beginning but how much we could make it grow into. My old friend who is a pastor would tell me, if you aren’t ready to fall or look stupid, then don’t fall in love (lol). But sincerely that is the bitter truth! When I lost my wife and kids, I feared love until I recalled that if it touched a heart, it would make the darkness fade into an endless sunny days. Can you prove that right?"
illegitime,"Oh, I miss ma. But then she is a strong woman my dear. Sometimes I call her Jesus’s mother (lol). She has a good heart and also I can tell you her instincts are like oracle. I already told her about you and she did say she likes you. As I have said, I don’t feel negative about any feelings I have right now, because it can’t be failed except for death. Truly, love needs no map, for it can find it’s way blindfolded. This kind of certainty comes, but once in a lifetime. Men always seem to wonder what it takes to get a woman. Like, what do they have to do to make a woman notice them? Men have to realize that they have to be sweet, caring, gentle, honest and still have that sweet little thing about them that drives any woman crazy: and that’s reaching her heart. No matter how much you try, if you don’t reach her heart, it won’t ever be worth-while. And really how did this happen if I have a space in your heart now and you haven’t met me to feel sentiments? It means I have gotten the most important part of the journey upfront (lol). Who shall say that the maiden so pretty and fair shall always have the greater man; and the ogre who walks to the beat of thundering clouds will never find her prince? Because really, love is destiny, and no one can really explain it."
illegitime,"Oh, my wife! I am indeed so delighted with your response to those questions. Once again in life, finally, I found you. As I write to you right here, I am crying and no matter how hard I try, I can’t stop this tears of joy. I am so speechless, please listen to this song, it explains every thing I have to say right now, (http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=6c64kUiqknY). Below is the lyrics. “Queen Of My Heart”"
illegitime,"ou are the sun in my day, the wind in my sky, the waves in my ocean, and the beat in my heart. I wish I was there to hold you tight instead of just send this loving, “Good Morning.” Thank you for being the one who calms all my inner fears. Your love is all I’ll ever need. YOU ARE STILL THE ONE AND WILL ALWAYS BE THE ONE!"
illegitime,"Our love is unmistakeable, it is unbreakable, it is untouchable. It will live and grow each second of our lives and the world will write a story of us. You see that kind of love that makes you feel like you are just somewhere under beautiful trees, dancing to the beautiful melody of the leaves. And if the world write a story of our love, we will be known until the end of time. I hope you can see inside my heart now, you and you alone lives in there. I love you …… and I want you to say that word to me next time we talk on phone. Please do not over work yourself, leave some things for us to do together when I return. Long kisses and hugs! Your Husband,"
illegitime,"Over the years, I have a tenant who has been paying $1500 every month to the pocket of the Government and just moved out. So right now, I am searching for a new tenant who would continue the payment so I don’t get fined or pay any additional money for delay in payment. The home would be mine when all the debt on it is cleared and I can enjoy whatever it brings from rental. But if I don’t find a new tenant till I finish this project, then I would have more than enough money to pay off the debt and not worry of finding a tenant any more."
illegitime,Rawr means hello in dinosaur. RAWR!
illegitime,"Right now, they left with my check after almost giving it to me. They said I will get it in few days if I fix the loop hole in their project. I called the door company and an additional $13,899 is needed if I have to change these doors. Dear, I really do understand what it feels like to know that a man you share a soul with is going through all these. Right from that moment we fell in love, our worries, our problems, our happiness, our joy, our life has become one. Nelson is such a good friend honey, immediately I told him, within the few hours I spent thinking of how to tell you, he went right away and took out the last $5000 in his wife’s account plus he pawned his old Harley bike for a few thousands and sent $8500 already. I couldn’t believe it when he called and said he sent $8500 and even apologized that he would have sent all if he could. I thanked him and show serious appreciation. I really do owe Nelson big time."
illegitime,Saw your profile and just had to say hi.
illegitime,"Simply said… I love you… Being with you is like having every single one of my wishes come true. Loving you has been the best thing to ever happen to me! Just had to let you know… you’re the best! I love you! There is no long distance about love; it always finds a way to bring hearts together, no matter how many miles are between them."
illegitime,"Since I got the money you sent, it has been much relief and great joy in the heart of every one. Once the electric pipes are completely installed and the POP are fixed , I am so happy that that would be the final stage and then I can stretch my bones once again. Honestly, it has not been an easy task. How wonderful it would be when I am finally done with this especially to know that I am coming directly to my woman. Darling, I really do hope you are doing great job on your strength, you have to be very strong in order to withstand this hot man… lol. I won’t wait till we get home, the whole world will know from the airport that Mrs Gold is now in the hands of Mr Gold. That reminds me, I looked at your gift today again and smiled knowing how happy you would feel when you get it, something I will never tell you till I see you at the airport. It is something so special and you can imagine what could be most special to a love. I am sure you can’t guess right cos it’s something that will make you open your mouth in great amazement, it would be what I’ll be giving you as I draw you close to kiss you at the air port.. Life is good, yes, it really is when one is so lucky to find his / her soul mate, a friend in deed, the driver of one’s heart, the cap that fit one’s head, a true partner, the co-pilot, the winner of one’s life, the stead firm in times of need, the great lover, the best kisser, the best love maker, the supporter, the protector, the down, the middle, the up, the remainder, the every day joy, the every day happiness, a woman that will stay and never leave, a woman to die by her side, the seer of the last breath. Darling, when I finally see you, I will say more than words can ever express. I love you more and more. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours Forever."
illegitime,"Since I left them, I have been thinking so hard and asking different questions. What if these people don’t agree with the $15k I have? What if they change their minds and say they need the whole money? I have closed all my accounts and got loans and sold some of my properties to come up with the $10million I brought here and there is no one else I can turn to expect for Nelson. But what if Nelson says he’s down for now? What would I do? I have invested so much, I mean I have put all I have in this project and this token amount should not delay my success at this point of my life. Never! It should not draw me back because I just want to complete this and retire and enjoy for the rest of my life. You may not know, I will be spending my life and eternity with you. All that I have and will ever have is also yours because I believe we are one. We will resume a world of laughter, happiness, joy, fulfillment of heart as soon as I arrive. I just want us together every moment of our lives. Life is too short my love, we can’t spend all our life working. Once I’m done here, we wouldn’t have to worry over money again for ever and ever so all I want is you and I together anywhere and every where. To love one another the way the world has never experienced."
illegitime,"Slowly ....I slide into you. ""Oh my god!!!!!! I feel so good!!!"" I stopped. You had all of you buried deep in yourself. ""Don't move"" I said. I was close to cuming. You could feel my wet cock inside of you. You started moving slowly at first, gently, kissing me again. You started moving faster. god I feel so good!!! I started moaning, calling your name ....ahhhhhhhhhh Debra.....I'm going to cum!!!"" ""Cum for me baby, you said, Fuck me.....Fuck me hard!!!, Oh yes, baby......there it is.....I'm going to cum!! I began to pound you harder. ""Oh god!!! thats it!!"", you could hear me say, as I pushed hard and deep into you one last time. We both came at the same time, sending us both over the edge. ""Don't move"", you asked me. You felt so good fucking you hard. When our breathing slowed down, I picked up your head looked down into your eyes and asked""Are you OK?"" ""You said"" ""I am more than OK,lol..lol..lol, baby."
illegitime,"So tell me how big is your family? I mean how many brothers and sisters you have? What about your parents? Dad died when I was just a kid, My Mom raised me up as a single Mom, she passed on May 12, 2001. I'm the only Child of my Parents, Chloe and Oshyn are the only close family I have got at the moment, they're my best friend, sister and everything to me."
illegitime,"So tell me when travelling do you travel alone or you like travelling with a Companion? I love travelling with my daughter, because she is my only family that I have now."
illegitime,"So tell me; what are some of the places you have visited? I have already lived in Italy when I was young, before moving to the states with my parents. I have been out of the States several times on different occasion, maybe on a work trip, or vacation trip. My work has took me to places like; Spain, Malaysia, England.While on vacation trip I and my daughter have been to; Switzerland, Italy, Yugoslavia,Greece, Bermuda, Paris, Rio DE Janeiro of Brazil, and Dubai. I would love my next vacation trip to be with that special someone, because I don’t believe I’m destined to travel this road alone; I look forward to sharing my last journey in love, laughter & friendship. Loving a woman is no longer enough for me. The genuine friendship that develops, enjoying each others company, the ability to communicate one’s needs, desires, hopes & dreams, for me, will sustain the relationship. I may not be perfect, but I am perfect, for someone. Looking for my ""Lover and Companion"" to live a fun loving life and ""Travel"" around the would with. I'm looking for a woman who is a good communicator."
illegitime,So tell me; what is your favorite food? My favorite food is Pasta. I love to cook great home made meals and try new recipes when I am in town with my daughter. I also love to exercise and the importance of being healthy and eating healthy. Would like a lady to cook with! So romantic!

A long term relationship with someone like you... I want to feel true love and happiness with you and share everything with you based on Love, Trust & Understanding."
illegitime,"something that wants me to relocate. I sold that house and bought a new one in stockton,CA That was my first time on a dating site and you are the first woman I choose to communicate with. I have now decided to stop visiting the site. I hate to communicate with more than one woman at a time. I rather focus on us and hope this be the last chapter of our love life. I must tell you this secret, I have a wonderful heart, when I am in a state to choose among many, I let my heart do it and it has never been wrong. There are millions of women on that dating site, I joined and I was so hopeful that despite the number of women, I will certainly go for my own destined woman. My heart never go wrong and when it pushes me to you, I knew I was going the right path. So glad you are one of my kind, we are both open minded and ready to fall in love in the hands of that wonderful partner."
illegitime,"Sometimes I do not blame the past because if not for the past, there won’t be our present. As far as we are not the bad type, god surely prepare us for a better future, a better place and a better life. Love is never created or controlled by mankind but by god himself. Tell me who wouldn’t like to fall in love? If we earn the whole world, gather all those treasures on this planet combined with the ones in all other planets and there is no love in our life, certainly we got nothing. Show me a Jack that wouldn’t die for Mary to live? Show me a Prince of Troy that wouldn’t do anything for the love of Ellen? Maximus died for he loved his wife, his children and his country. America is God’s own country only because of the love for the whole world. Tell me ……, what would we be if we don’t let love steal our souls? When we are finally together ~ And you look into my eyes ~ You will see what you mean to me ~ Every thing I want to do for the rest of my life ~ I want to do them for you, for love and for us ~ You will love this (http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=ZGoWtY_h4xo) Please take good care of yourself for me. Your love, B’Gold"

It is a love that is strong and enduring and will stand the test of time. I truly feel blessed that you have become a part of my life, and I cannot wait for the day that we can join our lives together"

illegitime,"SUCCESS AT LAST!!! Finally my dear LO, god will is done!!! The journey that seems so far has come to an end. Oh, you need to see how relieved I feel now. I just want to send this short message and then go to the hotel room to get some sleep right away. I mean I am so tired my love!"
illegitime,"Take my hands before I am too old (lol). I could go be with some friends to have fun, but they don’t really comprehend. I don’t need too much talking , without saying anything, all I need is some one who makes me want to sing. And you do a great job on that. I have written a song I would sing for you when I get to you. In less than few weeks I would complete this project and handover and come straight to you. Would you mind picking this old man from the airport? (lol)."

illegitime,That awkward moment when you try to message a guy/girl and all you can think of is hello.
illegitime,"The banking hall was so comfortable with the queue moving on and on, it was finally my turn to tender my check and I did with a short smile. The cashier, who has been frowning to all customers before me, looked at my check and saw the amount on it and she really amazed me with a very pleasant smile. That reminds me of every time I get to check my account balance at any bank before this project, I always get a smile for bankers are money lovers. Do not think I ever dated any of them (lol), I never did."
illegitime,"The comfort I feel in knowing that we can disagree, we can get through the roughest of times and still know in our hearts that we can’t live without each other is what makes it even more special. “It wouldn’t matter if it didn’t matter…” Baby, you matter to me and I know in my heart I truly matter to you. I am secure in your love as I know you are in mine. What more could we ask for than to be truly loved as we do each other and have found the one we have both been searching for all our lives. So, in closing, let me shout this to all…, “I LOVE YOU, ……, WITH ALL MY HEART AND SOUL!” HAPPY DAY TO YOU. Please get back to me as quickly as you can so I could call the head of the professionals and let him know when I want them to resume work. Thank you for being there for me. Love always,"
illegitime,"The interior decoration was completed today and I am so happy about that. First thing on ……, I will be having a meeting with the professionals that will install the electric pipes on the deck of the building and once they start, it will take three days to get done. Then after that, my local labors will fix the POP to cover the pipes and that will take another three days which is the end of this ever ending project. In total, I have a stretch of 6days to complete this and earn my biggest reward in my carrier. This means I will be retired in only few days to spend the remaining seconds of my life with you. Dear, be prepared to celebrate with me soon when I get paid. $30million is not a joke! Like I told you honey, please keep my secret to you and you alone because I will never discuss my business with any one expect for love. This is how much I have given my life to you. I believe that husband and wife should not keep secret from each other if truly they are in love. So I will never keep any thing from you my love, I want us to know each other in and out. For you to know me more than I know myself and for me to know you more than you know yourself. Without saying any word, just a sign on the face or body should be able to tell me or you what we mean. I want us to be inseparable twins (lol). Good night honey, I love you so! Your Husband,"
illegitime,"The only reason this was possible is because you must have portrayed yourself well and you have been yourself. That is good, because if I ever fall in love with you for beauty, I wouldn’t walk more than miles to see more beauty; if I love you for wealth, I wouldn’t walk more miles to see more; if I love you for smiles, I would see more on comedy shows (lol). But the only thing I can fall in love with is you, that can’t be gotten by anyone else because its being YOU! That is absolutely what no one can ever be. Like I said, it takes a life time to try knowing the reason why you feel the way you do with some people. The answers are never there. Trust me, the day relationships starts falling is the day people can figure out the exact reason they have loved each other."
illegitime,"The Time Is Now, I’m So Happy! Hi love, Please start today first, by listening to this song (http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=MSKEOlWOytA&feature=related) from my heart to you and then you can read down. Also, I forwarded you my flight confirmation."
illegitime,The truth? I like you a lot. And I don’t even know you yet. I just have an idea.
illegitime,"The woman said I should have my sit and she went in to where I don’t know. After some couple of minutes, she came back to her section and the security man walked towards me and quietly said the manager would like to see me. Then, I was even more happy because I felt I was about to see the only one who would handle my case with the best attention. I felt so excited. I mean, I have been thinking and dreaming of being on the plane taking me to you since yesterday. When I got in, he said to me to have a sit and held my check looking at it again and again. He asked how a visitor in the country is able to get so much money so I explained the project I just completed in their country and he quickly apologized. I then said I needed some of the cash for my flight and some other stuffs while the remaining should be put in an account I can access when I get to the States. The manager said he only wanted me to speak before explaining some things to me and then he proceeded; mister Ben, the check you are holding is a Region’s Bank check which has only few branches in the United States and no where else in the world. He also said my check is like a cash because it is a cashier’s check but the only thing is there is no way for them to process a check having such a huge amount of money belonging to a United States Bank here in SA. He said if I can find my way to the States and get into Region’s Bank with the check, I will get cash instantly. But it would even be difficult and take long time for a another bank in the USA to cash the check same day except for Region’s Bank. And finally, he concluded that I can only get an instant cash in Region’s Bank in the States."
illegitime,"There is this woman whom I just met, and I could be scared about how she has gotten my attention, but I would be stupid to submit to fears. I noticed that she already has a place that can not be replaced in my heart. Who could ever think of hurting such a woman who only wants happiness? I want you to help me find her and tell her, I am not known for fears. I know a journey of a thousand years start with a single step. A man who wants to fly must at least learn to stand on his feet! Tell her if she is willing, I would love to take her hands. I am a man who gives nothing but everything. Once I have her hand, I can promise her forever. Tell her I know this is not going to be a kid walk. Tell her I know there are times we would argue in future. But tell her I would teach her to know that even while we argue we would still be holding hands for there are many sides to a coin. Tell her life is short, but we can make paradise out of it. Tell her her worries have become mine, because I do not really know how she has done it. Tell her, that coming across her was by chance, communicating with her was by choice, but then falling in love with her is beyond my control."
illegitime,"This morning has been a big fun for me, I listened to the song I sent to you previously, it was so nice, I dance in wild imagination that you are right in front of me, holding me tight as we both keep taking gentle steps round the house. Darling, if you close your eyes and you are holding my hands, you are no different from that woman with eyes opened because I will be leading you to the right path. I cant wait to be out of here for us to start our new life together. I sang for us and put your name in the song, this same song is the first I would sing for you first thing when we meet. I did picture you with me on the cruise laughing so hard in my arms (lol). Love is a noble act of self-giving, offering trust, faith, and loyalty. The more you love, the more you lose a part of yourself, yet you don’t become less of who you are; you end up being complete with your loved ones. I do cherish your presence in me. There is this gift I want to buy for you but that would remain a secret until we meet at the airport. Waiting impatiently to hear from you."
illegitime,To The Door Company Good Morning Sweetest of Souls….. Thank you my sweet–for being you. Amazing and wonderful and a heart so true! You’re kind and loving and always make me smile. I get the butterflies every time its your number I dial. Even when you are not able to answer the phone I still can hear your sweet voice Telling me its ok love! I think my heart skips a beat when I hear your voice. To love you forever–I have no choice.
illegitime,"Today, you are so far away and I’m not being able to hold you, kiss you, or even able to tell you I love you every day, as we go through the hardest thing we have ever had to go through in the past weeks we have been together. Yes, I miss you and can’t wait to get on the flight taking me to you, to be able to wrap my arms around you and hold you close to my heart. To lay next to you in bed and bring an end to the misery of empty pillow. Days go by and nights get longer. It makes me stronger and stronger. One thing I want you to know is I love you and you will forever be in my heart. Love you forever,"
illegitime,"Tomorrow morning, I will call the door company, whether they would accept this amount or not, I don’t know. You can see honey, the road to success is such a rough road. Nothing good in life comes easy!!! Just as our life is about to start, it’s the best that can ever happen to us but see the road, it’s kind of rough. But I know in the end of every struggle, it will all be fine. I keep asking myself ‘what if I don’t have you and Nelson to stand by me this period?’ And the answer I get is ‘perhaps it would have been mission impossible’. I have worked too hard and too long to jeopardize this great success. Now I believe that the greater the success on the road, the longer the ladder one has to climb. Because I have you, because you love me, because you believe in God and the angels, I see us climb this success ladder together. I see us together before the end of this week. I want you to know I love you with all my life and I appreciate all you have done for me and I promise to pay back all your money and start a new life with you in a short while. I can only wish the door company accepts the $8,500 or would you be able to send $1,500 today to make it $10,000 so I could at least beg the door company with that and promise them that I will balance them the remaining $3,899 tomorrow once the door is fixed and I get my money? Please love, I am sorry all these is what we can’t run from, but once all is settled, nothing will hinder us again. I love you so much honey. Missing you so bad and I want to be with you honey. Kisses and hugs."
illegitime,"Tomorrow, I should be able to get my flight confirmation to you. Oh, that reminds me, thank you for the extra, it really helped sorting things I never expected. The agent says it took longer than expected so I had to pay additional $300. First thing on Monday, I am going to see James who promised to help with the $10,000.00. Also, the man at the lawyer’s office called me today and said I should check on Monday. You see honey, good news here and there. I can’t wait honey, I really can’t! Sleep well my beautiful LO. Very soon, we won’t be sleeping alone and waking up alone any longer. Longest Kisses and hugs ever. Your Husband,"
illegitime,"Topic: Ben From Ourtime Hi Angel , I’m so excited to read from you so soon. Please confirm you receive this message so I could send more about me. I am looking for my second half, a woman to spend the remaining seconds of my life with. Waiting to here from you, Smiles~ Hi there, I did sent you an email already. Please keep in touch on there. Cheers!"
illegitime,"Topic: Hello My 101% Match Hey, how are you doing today? Wow was the first thing I said when I went through your picture / profile and I wonder why a woman like you is still single. Perhaps, all the men around you are blind (lol). I think we are probably looking for real stuff on"
illegitime,"Urgent! My love, Been on this computer for hours thinking of how to tell you this but what can I do? The only person I can share my life with is you, you come first and then Nelson. You are the second half that completes me. The inspection team of Abu Dahbi just left as at the time I called you and they brought my check but they couldn’t give it to me based on little changes that occurred in their project. I was supposed to use secure steel roller-doors for all the entrances to the warehouses but I couldn’t use that for all of them based on changes in budget and market value difference between the time I made my budget and the time I went to get them at the market. I was only able to use these steel roller-doors for the warehouses in Cape Town, Pretoria, Durban, Port Elizabeth (Eastern Cape), Kimberley (Northen Cape) and Polokwane (Limpopo) while I used aluminum roller-doors for the warehouses in Nelspruit (Mpumalanga) and Johannesburg."
illegitime,"Walking through a crowded street, I could still hear my own heartbeat. So many people around this world my dear, tell me, where do I find someone like you? Pls take me to your heart, take me to your soul, show me that wonders can be true. They say, nothing lasts forever, we are only here today, love is now or never, pls bring me far away! Give me your hand and hold me, show me what love is, maybe I haven’t got a clue, be my guardian star and make me know love can last forever."
illegitime,"We are getting together soon honey. What more can make us happier than this? You can not imagine how happy I am now and words can not even express it. I wish you a wonderful day ahead honey. The professionals will be starting work today and will finish in three days time. I love you more than life itself and nothing will change that. Coming home to you soon, Your Husband."
illegitime,"Well, I do believe it is too early to discuss distance because wherever I find my true love is where I would live for the rest of my life. If you find a wicked love close to you and a true love far away, I bet you would wait for the true love to come rather than go for the close wicked love that will end up hurting your feelings. True love knows no bound nor distance nor limit. It doesn’t need a map either cos it will always find its way. There is something in me that wants to continue with you and for your information, this is my time on a dating site in my whole life. We should get to know each other and see where life leads us. I am matured enough and I know what I want in life. I mean I am looking for a relationship that would be my last till my dieing days. I’ve got a million words to say to you but I would prefer a better communication via personal emails as I wouldn’t like to come on a dating site all the time. I am a one woman man and so I rather get going with you and you alone. Looking forward to your response / email. Cheers!"

I can't wait to have sex with my future wife. I am a sexual person and i love the thought of being intimate with her in every way. I want a wife who feels the same way. Who has the same sexual appetite as i do and desires to be as intimate as i do. But all of this must be within the context of a relationship. So i will protect the sanctity of my future marriage.

legitime,"  In another scheme, scammers ask victims to receive funds in the form of a cashier's check, money order, or wire transfer, claiming they are out of the country and unable to cash the instruments or receive the funds directly. The scammers ask victims to redirect the funds to them or to an associate to whom they purportedly owe money. In a similar scheme, scammers ask victims to reship packages instead of redirecting funds. In these examples, victims risk losing money and may incur other expenses, such as bank fees and penalties, and in some instances face prosecution.  Victims who have agreed to meet in person with an online love interest have been reported missing, or injured, or in one instance, deceased. IC3 complainants most often report the countries of Nigeria, Ghana, England, and Canada as the location of the scammers. If you are planning to meet someone in person that you have met online, the IC3 recommends using caution, especially if you plan to travel to a foreign country, and, at the very least:      Do not travel alone.     Read all travel advisories associated with the countries you will visit. Travel advisories are available at http://travel.state.gov/.     Contact the United States Embassy in the country you plan to visit.  "
legitime,"  The IC3 is warning the public to be wary of romance scams in which scammers target individuals who search for companionship or romance online. Someone you know may be ""dating"" someone online who may appear to be decent and honest. However, be forewarned: the online contact could be a criminal sitting in a cyber café with a well-rehearsed script that scammers have used repeatedly and successfully. Scammers search chat rooms, dating sites, and social networking sites looking for victims. The principal group of victims is over 40 years old and divorced, widowed, elderly, or disabled, but all demographics are at risk.  Scammers use poetry, flowers, and other gifts to reel in victims, the entire time declaring their ""undying love."" These criminals also use stories of severe life circumstances, tragedies, deaths in the family, injuries to themselves, or other hardships to keep their victims concerned and involved in their schemes. Scammers also ask victims to send money to help overcome a financial situation they claim to be experiencing. These are all lies intended to take money from unsuspecting victims. "

legitime," “A do or die affair” is a common description of Nigerian elections, which underlines the competitiveness and acrimony that characterize the quadrennial political ritual. The recently concluded 2015 general elections were fiercer than most, with expectations that they would end in a contentious stalemate at best, and engulf the country in violent political crisis at worst. Many people stockpiled food, the affluent and many expatriate workers took strategically timed holidays abroad, and Nigerians in regions of the country distant from their birthplaces sent their families home in expectation of a prolonged post-election crisis. Yet, in the end, the actual conduct and outcome of the elections defied expectations. Not only did Nigeria conduct its most credible and transparent elections since independence with minimal violence but, for the first time in the country's history, an opposition party – the All Progressives Congress (APC) – defeated an entrenched ruling party (the Peoples' Democratic Party, PDP). The peaceful and credible conduct of these polls has set Nigeria on a trajectory towards consolidating its democracy, transitioning from a largely unstable and expedient experiment in 1999 to the realm of political maturity. This briefing discusses how this was achieved despite the challenging context. "

legitime," A nation's heroes are rarely fixed and are frequently reassessed and reinterpreted by new generations. In the case of a number of African countries, the very masculine liberation heroes of yesteryear often prove divisive, emerging from very fraught histories. In this context, there are moves to broaden the pantheon of heroes and make history more inclusive. In Kenya, where the contested history of Mau Mau provides several heroes, Mekatilili wa Menza, a female figure from the coast who played a significant role in Giriama resistance against the British in 1913, has emerged as a national heroine. The article introduces this historical figure using published sources, and then traces the historical arc of her memorialization and evocation from post-Independence praise as a feminist icon to her recent elevation to the Kenyan pantheon of national heroes and heroines. In doing so, it illustrates the ways in which her story is being retold on the coast by Giriama organizations that have made her a central figure in local heritage movements. Finally, in the changed context of devolved Kenya since the 2010 constitution came into force after the 2013 election, this article shows how her story gained further salience as coastal politicians claimed her memory for regional goals. It argues that while figures such as Mekatilili may appear less divisive than Mau Mau, how their history is told and used is equally political. "

Oregon, Arizona and Washington have all sent firefighters and equipment to help, and there’s a pending request with Australia for their fire crews, Newsom said.  But not all requests from California for out-of-state resources are being granted. Officials with the National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates interstate firefighting deployments, said they’ve been inundated with requests from across the West and have redirected some of California’s requests back home.

legitime," African conflicts are highly represented in cross-national conflict event datasets, and their causes are increasingly investigated in quantitative analyses. Many of these datasets make use of international media reports to compile information on different forms of conflict events, ranging from violent armed conflict to forms of social unrest such as protests and riots. African studies scholars more commonly rely on local news sources to study these phenomena. In this research note, we investigate the effect of using different types of news sources to analyze conflict patterns in Africa by comparing the coverage of conflict events in Nigeria by three datasets: The Social Conflict in Africa Database (SCAD), the Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset (ACLED) and a dataset developed by the authors, based on Nigerian sources and focusing on the period April 2014–March 2015. We investigate the overlap between the datasets and whether this is affected by event characteristics, including violent and non-violent events. The comparison shows empirically the important differences that can exist, in terms of both the absolute number and the sub-national distribution of reported conflict events. Such variations between datasets in terms of event, but also time and geographical coverage require careful reflection by users. "

So they’re people who are vulnerable, who may be desperately looking for love.  And again, they will manipulate that victim and endear themselves and gain their trust. And then they’ll start asking for money. The perpetrator will state that they have an emergency, that they need money for a job—maybe overseas—that they have some type of medical emergency, and they need funds. So they promise that they’ll repay the victim as soon as the victim sends the money. But the victims never receive their money back. "

legitime," As socio-medical phenomena, epidemics are revealing of the cultures in which they are experienced. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa exposes antecedent tensions between state and society, and, on a broader canvas, between the global north and south. As a contribution to the emerging literature on the social ramifications of HIV/AIDS, this article examines the saga of the Nigerian physician and immunologist, Dr Jeremiah Abalaka, who like other innovators in sub-Saharan Africa claims to have developed a curative HIV vaccine. Whilst articulating the social conditions that enabled Abalaka to thrive, the article explores the marked differences in the reaction to his ‘discovery’ among state representatives, the scientific establishment, the general public, people living with HIV, and the media. Finally, the article valorizes the emergence of new actors in the African health sector, and the diversity of strategies used by ordinary people to achieve and maintain wellness. "

legitime," Collections of tales are a favourite literary convention of the 14th century. Boccaccio's Decameron is the best-known example before Chaucer's time, but Chaucer in The Canterbury Tales outshines his predecessors. He does so in the range and vitality of the stories in his collection, from the courtly tone of 'The Knight's Tale' to the rough and often obscene humour of those known technically as fabliaux. He does so also in the detail and humour of the framework holding the stories together. His account of the pilgrims as they ride from London to Canterbury, with their constant bickering and rivalry, amounts to a comic masterpiece in its own right. The pilgrims, thirty of them including Chaucer himself, gather one spring day at the Tabard in Southwark. The host of the inn, Harry Bailly, is a real contemporary of Chaucer's (his name features in historical records). He will act as their guide on the route to Canterbury and he proposes that they pass the time on their journey by telling stories. Each pilgrim is to tell two on the way out and two on the way back. Whoever is judged to have told the best tale will have a free supper at the Tabard on their return. "

Moreover, concealing information about a felony from law enforcement is a crime.

legitime," Drawing on county-level data from Kansas for the period 1977–2011, we examine whether plausibly exogenous increases in the number of establishments licensed to sell alcohol by the drink are related to violent crime. During this period, 86 out of 105 counties in Kansas voted to legalise the sale of alcohol to the general public for on-premises consumption. Using legalisation as an instrument, we show that a 10% increase in drinking establishments is associated with a 3–5% increase in violent crime. The estimated relationship between drinking establishments and property crime is also positive, although smaller in magnitude. "

English Journal is refereed, and virtually all manuscripts are read by three or more outside peer reviewers who are teachers and teacher educators. (Peer review means that the coeditors ask for assistance from qualified readers in making decisions about acceptances and non-acceptances.) We will attempt to reach a decision on each article within five months. The decision on manuscripts submitted in response to a specific call for manuscripts will be made after the call deadline. "
legitime," ensions around the agency have been escalating for weeks, especially after President Trump announced he would block its funding to impede its ability to process ballots. On Tuesday, DeJoy retreated from the cutbacks, which included prohibitions on overtime and extra mail-delivery trips and the removal of hundreds of mail-sorters and public collection boxes, after the public backlash. “We all feel bad about what the dip in our service level has been,” he said Friday.  But some of those changes won’t be reversed. For example, any mailbox or sorter that’s already been removed will not be reinstalled. “There’s no intention to do that. They’re not needed, sir,” DeJoy told Peters of the sorters. "

legitime," Every self help book out there proclaims the importance of not worrying about what people think, and creatively, it may be the hardest one to put into practice. When you submit your work to the world, you’re putting yourself out there for others to appraise your creative effort. The way your work is marketed or whether you even get hired basically depends on their opinion. This is a common one that trips up many creative people. With the right strategy, though, it’s completely possible to be true to your vision but still cater to business parameters. "

legitime," Experts say humans have about 60,000 to 80,000 thoughts a day, and the majority of them are negative. This voice extinguishes our great ideas and makes us feel like foolish dreamers. I call it the monster in your head. This strange creature is clever in its tactics, and it loves to predict the future. “Why bother interviewing for that role?” it reminds you. “You always freeze up anyway.” It gives us an easy out from putting in the bravery required to step up. If that’s not enough, constant negative thoughts take a toll on your physical health over time. Because of the mind-body connection, these thoughts can affect your blood pressure, immune system, and your heart health. "
legitime," External instruments can be used to estimate dynamic causal effects directly without an intervening VAR step. This method uses an instrumental variables (IV) version of what is called in the forecasting literature a direct multistep forecasting regression; in the impulse response literature, this method is called a local projection. Alternatively, the instruments can be used in conjunction with a VAR to identify structural impulse response functions; this is the IV version of an iterated multistep forecast. The use of external instruments has opened a new and rapidly growing research programme in macroeconometrics, in which credible identification is obtained using as-if random variation in the shock of interest that is distinct from – external to – the macroeconomic shocks hitting the economy. In many applications, the instrument is constructed as a partial measure of the shock of interest: the quantity of oil kept from market because of a political disruption, a change in fiscal policy not related to business cycle conditions, or the part of a monetary shock revealed during a monetary policy announcement window. Such constructed measures typically have measurement error, which in general leads to bias if the measure is treated as the true shock. However, that measurement error need not compromise the validity of the measure as an instrument. As in the microeconometric setting, finding such instruments is not easy. Still, in our view this research programme holds out the potential for more credible identification than is typically provided by SVARs identified using internal restrictions. "

legitime," From synesthetic poems to questioning poems to the ghazal, Lightning Paths: 75 Poetry Writing Exercises has something fun or fascinating for every student and teacher as they explore the possibilities of poetry writing. The exercises teach and utilize technique while also focusing on and inspiring the intuitive and imaginative qualities of poetry. Each poem type includes an introduction explaining the exercise’s goal, detailed instructions, and a student example. The 75 activities are divided into three sections: exercises that focus on different types of imagery and ways to generate fresh imagery; exercises born out of unusual prompts and ideas that engage a writer’s experiences in the real world; and exercises related to what form might look like or how it might function.

legitime," From the Southern California deserts to the Sierra Nevada to the vineyards and movie sets and architectural landmarks left by modern mortals, little of the state has been left unscathed by wildfire.

legitime," From what we can tell, these are usually criminal organizations that work together. And once a victim becomes a victim, in that they send money, they will oftentimes be placed on what’s called a “sucker list.” And their names and identities are shared with other criminals. And they will be targeted for future recruitment.  I always tell people, when we try to spread the word, if you don’t know somebody, don’t send them money. Try to research that person’s profile that you’re getting involved with, and try to do some due diligence. But, you know, we’re all human. We all make mistakes. And I just hope victims who have fallen prey to this can learn and hopefully not enter into another scam. We have seen victims become victimized again. So I just ask that victims try to learn from the experience and try to share their experience with others so that other people can learn from their experience and not become victimized as well. "

legitime," Ghana has recently joined the ranks of oil-producing states with a projected output of 120,000 barrels per day. This has greatly elevated hopes among the general public, but also sparked fears of a ‘Nigerian scenario’ in which oil becomes a problem rather than a solution. This article argues that Ghana, as a latecomer to the oil industry, may possess a structural immunity against the natural resource curse. The argument centres on three main factors: the country's stable political system, its relatively robust and diversified economy, and the strength of civil society. As a result, the usual symptoms linked to oil extraction across the developing world are unlikely to turn the country upside down. Instead, we suggest that the ‘curse’ should be perceived as a treatable ‘disease’. The article pursues this analogy by showing that, since the discovery of oil, Ghana has been strengthening its ‘immune system’ through a new legal framework, improvements in transparency and accountability, and modest attempts to strengthen non-resource sectors of the economy.

legitime," Here in the Bay Area, we are fortunate to have good-standing working relationships with a number of companies, including Uber, as the U.S. Attorney mentioned. These relationships help the flow of information and allow us to pursue bad actors and assist companies in their recovery from data breaches.  We encourage companies to develop a relationship with the FBI and local law enforcement prior to an incident, and incorporate us into their incident response plans. We are working to get ahead of the threat and be predictive in the way we approach cybersecurity. We cannot impose consequences on our cyber adversaries if companies do not step forward and provide us with evidence of an intrusion, and no one will come forward if they think that all that will come from it is shame.

legitime," his article sheds new light on the migration of Africans to the European Union by looking at how spatial mobility relates to migrant morality, informed by in-depth qualitative interviews with members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in Paris. Although issues such as discrimination and exclusion are salient features of contemporary migration, the process of migration across space in the ‘age of borders’ also forces migrants to appraise their shared moral values and ethical standards. Using migrant morality as an entry point, the article demonstrates how borders define migrant lives, irrespective of their legal status. The process of negotiating these borders leads to profound experiences of self-doubt, the testing and alteration of gender relations, and processes of self-evaluation and ethical self-fashioning that serve in both shaping migrant life as well as in producing forms of resistance. The article reveals how migrants are embedded in multi-layered experiences that are simultaneously personal, social, spiritual, and political. "

legitime," I have a friend who’s a ridiculously gifted singer, but I’m not sure if she’s aware of it. She’s a theatrical soprano with a vocal range that’s out of this world. With a degree in music and teaching, she truly loves what she does, but something has stopped her from moving forward over the years. It’s her lack of belief in herself, and I sense that she doesn’t feel she deserves the creative fulfillment she longs for. This is something she needs to work past, but what’s also hurting her is her resentment of others who are putting themselves out there. “Oh my gosh, she’s so off key,” she quietly griped to me when we stopped at a trendy lounge to hear a jazz quartet led by a sultry singer. “I would sing it better!” "

legitime," In some situations the victim may be unknowingly recruited as a “money mule”: someone who transfers money illegally on behalf of others. Actors groom their victims over time and convince them to open bank accounts under the guise of sending or receiving funds. Grooming is defined as preparing a victim to conduct fraudulent activity on their behalf through communications intended to develop a trust relationship. These accounts are used to facilitate criminal activities for a short period of time. If the account is flagged by the financial institution, it may be closed and the actor will either direct the victim to open a new account or begin grooming a new victim.  In other situations, the actor claims to be a European citizen or an American living abroad. After a few months of developing trust, the actor will tell the victim about a lucrative business opportunity. The actor will inform the victim there are investors willing to fund the project, but they need a U.S. bank account to receive funds. The victim is asked to open a bank account or register a limited liability company in the victim’s name and then to receive and send money from that account to other accounts controlled by the actor.  "
legitime," In the nationwide debates in the build-up to the Ghana elections of December 2016, the New Patriotic Party, then in the opposition, claimed that 76,000 individuals were registered on both the Togolese and the Ghanaian voters’ registers, casting doubt on the citizenship status of voters who crossed the border from Togo to vote in Ghana. The issues that political parties continually raise about the voters’ register result in recurrent debates about identification documents and belonging. This article poses the underlying questions that many election analyses overlook: who is the electorate? Who decides who belongs to the nation? I argue that the criteria for belonging are neither those that are set in the law, nor those that seem to be suggested by political parties, but those that are decided at a local level where communities are the real gatekeepers of the vote. This article contributes to the literature on elections in Africa by highlighting the porosity of borders in a mobile world, not purely in terms of electoral outcomes, but in terms of broader issues about citizenship and belonging.

legitime," Ken Lindblom and Leila Christenbury return with the second volume in the Continuing the Journey series, this time focusing on authentic writing instruction for middle and high school classrooms. The authors draw on what research has taught them about writing—concepts deeply rooted in personal identity and real-world experience—and why we must teach writing accurately, effectively, and fearlessly. As in the previous volume, the book includes visits to an ideal Teachers’ Lounge, featuring highly experienced colleagues and well-known researchers in English teaching. Topics covered include responding to student writing, handling the paper load, teaching grammar and usage in the context of writing, and seeking real-world feedback. "

legitime," Liane,  As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to  manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single  buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above  market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades,  offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were  bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index  calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated  financial swaps for San Juan.  We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:  1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.   2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and        October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that  are dramatically different.   I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index.  It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to  conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me  anytime I can assist you towards this goal.  Sincerely,  Phillip Allen   "

legitime," Many cities in Africa have experienced building booms over the last 15 years. This article combines theoretical insights from the varieties of capitalism and varieties of residential capitalism literatures to examine the development of urban housing provision and real estate in Africa. It identifies two patterns of residential capitalism, the statist market economy and the hierarchical market economy types, and draws on a comparison of Luanda, Angola and Nairobi, Kenya to illustrate their respective differences. The two patterns reflect how governments, the private sector, and residents interact around the provision and purchase of housing in diverse political and economic contexts. The article suggests that the features of urban housing construction and real estate markets in the capitals of Angola and Kenya may serve as prototypes for broader patterns of capitalist development in these countries and elsewhere on the continent.

legitime," Most of us have been raised to blend in, which is kind of sad. At a developmental age, that behavior doesn’t really nurture the goal of getting to know who we are at a core level. Secondly, as artists, it doesn’t help us recognize what makes our heart sing creatively. You may have grown up in a house that idealized stiff societal norms or hung around people with narrow ideas on life choices. If that sounds familiar to you, it’s important now that you honestly check in with what you love, what you can’t stand, what makes you unique, and what you actually value. Listen carefully to that inner voice and let go of the static noise around you. If you’ve always known exactly who you are and what you want, that’s an amazing gift. Hold onto it and preserve it throughout your creative journey. "

legitime," ntiretroviral treatment (ART) has become a ubiquitous feature of South African life. By early 2015, three million people had begun ART in South Africa. In the light of widespread positive responses to the availability of treatment, early ethnographies that stressed suspicion, fear, and resentment need to be revisited. In this article, I re-examine my own data on an early encounter between the technologies of ART and the population of a rural district in the Eastern Cape province. I also return to Didier Fassin's ethnography in which he placed ordinary people's responses to AIDS in a history of suspicion and resentment. The article focuses in particular on the support groups that ART users formed and argues that they were the sites of creative responses to ART in which ordinary people, primarily women, bent the new technologies and esoteric languages they encountered to an array of endogenous purposes. The article concludes that ART was incorporated into a politics of hopeful expectation rather than a politics of resentment. "
legitime," Of these two great English alliterative poems, the second is entirely anonymous and the first virtually so. The narrator of Piers Plowman calls himself Will; occasional references in the text suggest that his name may be Langland. Nothing else, apart from this poem, is known of him. Piers Plowman exists in three versions, the longest amounting to more than 7000 lines. It is considered probable that all three are by the same author. If so he spends some twenty years, from about 1367, adjusting and refining his epic creation. Piers the ploughman is one of a group of characters searching for Christian truth in the complex setting of a dream. Though mainly a spiritual quest, the work also has a political element. It contains sharply observed details of a corrupt and materialistic age (Wycliffe is among Langland's English contemporaries). Where Piers Plowman is tough and gritty, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (dating from the same period) is more polished in its manner and more courtly in its content. The characters derive partly from Arthurian legend.  "

Taking stock of all the things in life we have to be thankful for shifts our perspective when we’re waiting to hear back about an opportunity. When I feel that familiar panic creep in, I take a full bodied breath and begin to focus on things like my family, my loving partner, and the creative successes I’ve already had, and it brings me back to the present. In fact, studies show that gratitude increases people’s self-control and their ability to wait for things. When you feel the death grip of impatience take hold, jot down a list of everything you’re truly thankful for. Read that list back and feel your outlook shift back into the present moment. "

legitime," onfidence/romance fraud occurs when an actor deceives a victim into believing they have a trust relationship—whether family, friendly, or romantic—and leverages the relationship to persuade the victim to send money, provide personal and financial information, or purchase items of value for the actor. In some cases, the victim is persuaded to launder money on behalf of the actor.  Actors often use online dating sites to pose as U.S. citizens located in a foreign country, U.S. military members deployed overseas, or U.S. business owners seeking assistance with lucrative investments. THREAT  In 2017, more than 15,000 people filed complaints with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) alleging they were victims of confidence/romance fraud and reporting losses of more than $211 million. In 2018, the number of victims filing these complaints increased to more than 18,000, with more than $362 million in losses—an increase of more than 70 percent over the previous year.  In 2018, confidence/romance fraud was the seventh most commonly reported scam to the IC3 based on the number of complaints received, and the second costliest scam in terms of victim loss.  IC3 receives victim reports from all age, education, and income brackets. However, the elderly, women, and those who have lost a spouse are often targeted.  "

legitime," Phillip, Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the  requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport  trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;  the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,  on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic  consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time  consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the  inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the  consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can  arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to  happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the  consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude  building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the  future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm  requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project  plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.  The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to  themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this  project. I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been  good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now  we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve. Richard   From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated  positions, I think we still have the following issues: We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had  three meetings which brought out very different issues from different  traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader  requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to  be outside the scope of position consolidation. Things left to do: I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to  make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this  project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this  project and which fall out of scope. For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and  work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all  drill downs. Use the above to formulate a project plan. Things requested thus far (no particular order): Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal  ticker. Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that  add up existing position manager rows/columns). New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical,  transport, swaps, options, ... Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values  of all curves on which the desk has a position. Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be  shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid  would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the  appropriate positions to show for each: Gas Daily for monthly index, Physical gas for Nymex, Physical gas for Inside Ferc, Physical gas for Mid market. Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of  using official valuations. Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks. Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS: Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility  skew and correlations. Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.   Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a  gamma grid. Valuation of Gas Daily options. A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD. Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets. Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position  manager. Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms,  prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change. Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker. Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of  individual deals on the position total in a grid cell. Benchmark positions in TDS. Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit  and explicit position break out issues. -- Allan. PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for  transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that  point."
legitime," Recent literature on Sino-African resource politics emphasizes the agency of African elites in relation to Chinese capital and state agencies, yet whether African elites have gained agency over the structure of African economies remains debatable. This article questions how agency has been understood in analyses of Sino-Africa relations by identifying the nature and limits of Ghanaian agency in bilateral and multilateral aid relations since the discovery of oil in 2007. First, although the agency of Ghanaian elites has shaped the outcomes of recent bilateral investments, Ghanaian state agency has been exercised primarily in brokering external sources of finance and in relation to domestic institutions and political factions. Second, Chinese investment did shift the aid modalities and the relative power of Ghana’s traditional development partners, but international finance institutions and US agencies maintained influence over macro-economic governance and sectoral policy, respectively. As such, the scope of Ghanaian agency in relation to external finance and bilateral and multilateral relations was narrow, and market orthodoxies of development remained dominant. Undue attribution of agency over economic and political structures can be avoided by situating African agency within the social and material context of transnational industries. "
legitime," Research on Kenya’s 2013 elections has suggested that a “peace narrative” was deliberately promoted by an establishment elite to delegitimize protest and justify the use of excessive force. It has also tended to see the Kenyan case as exceptional and to assume that such a narrative was only possible because of the 2007/2008 post-election violence. We agree that peace campaigns are often particularly intense in the wake of violence and that they can be manipulated to generate a “peaceocracy”, a system in which an emphasis on peace is used to prioritize stability and order to the detriment of democracy. However, by comparing Kenya to Ghana and Uganda, two countries that have had very different experiences of elections and election-related violence, we demonstrate that peace messaging is neither unique to countries that have experienced recent electoral conflict, nor a recent phenomenon. Instead, we highlight the pervasiveness of peace narratives across the sub-continent, which we show is due to a number of factors. These include but are not limited to the way that elections are used to assert and perform state autonomy and an associated ideal of elections as orderly processes; the capacity of multiple actors to instrumentalize the ideal of orderly elections; a popular fear of electoral violence even in countries where it is rare; a growing tendency to individualize responsibility for peace; and the availability of international funding. Taken together, these factors help to explain the rise of peace messaging. At the same time, we argue that the risk that this messaging will foster a “peaceocracy” varies markedly and that the likelihood of incumbent manipulation is greatest in countries with a recent history of civil conflict and where the quality of democracy is already low.

legitime," Romance scams occur when a criminal adopts a fake online identity to gain a victim’s affection and trust. The scammer then uses the illusion of a romantic or close relationship to manipulate and/or steal from the victim.  The criminals who carry out romance scams are experts at what they do and will seem genuine, caring, and believable. Con artists are present on most dating and social media sites. "
legitime," Romance schemes usually involve a perpetrator assuming an online identity, and it’s for the purpose of tricking victims. So what they do is, they search out vulnerable women, generally speaking. Men can be targets as well, but it’s generally women, usually above the age of 50.  Anyone is subject to this. If you’re online, if you’re using the Internet, as long as you have money and you’re willing to give it, then you could be a target.  They’ll hunt through these various networking sites, and they’ll find somebody who may be a good target, and they use what the victim has put on their profile page. So you have to be very careful about what you post because they’ll use that to manipulate the victim. They’ll develop a relationship very quickly. They’ll try to endear themselves to the victims. They’ll say whatever the victim wants to hear. "

legitime," Significant riots occurred in London in August 2011. The riots took place in highly localised geographical areas, with crime going up hugely in the affected sub-wards. The criminal justice response was to make sentencing for rioters much more severe. We show a significant drop in riot crimes across London in the six months after the riots, consistent with a deterrence effect from the tougher sentencing. More evidence of general deterrence comes from the observation that crime also fell in the post-riot aftermath in areas where rioting did not take place. "

legitime," Since the 1990s, there has been an upsurge in conflicts of autochthony in several parts of the world. Autochthony invokes a sense of a politics of belonging and an attachment to the land. In Nigeria, the phenomenon raises questions of citizenship and can reinforce exclusionary practices which in turn provoke widespread violence between different Nigerian populations. Infrastructure provision in a communal conflict environment is a critical element of autochthony struggle, which has yet to be fully explored. Relying on archival sources, focus group discussions, interviews and observation, this article interrogates how the interactions between autochthony and space stimulates communal conflicts and affect infrastructure provision in Jos, Nigeria. The article focuses on how the ‘Black September’ incident in 2001 and its aftermath in Jos has defined citizenship. It argues that the politics of belonging is embedded in infrastructure provision, and understanding this relationship is crucial to understanding and addressing the conflicts in Jos and beyond. "

legitime," Sleight of hand in manipulating the computation of results has become the new might for deciding who wins presidential elections. It appears that whoever controls the computation exercises a right to take advantage and win, and whoever loses or relinquishes control of the computation loses the election. As incumbents do not want to be identified with direct interference or rigging, hacking has become an alternative means. This raises a serious challenge for election management bodies (EMBs) and a new frontier for international observation. As electronic data management has become a key battleground, international observers cannot restrict their monitoring to the manual process alone. However, individual states may have data sensitivity concerns about granting electronic monitoring access to partisan international observers. Institutionalizing internationally agreed protocols that would allow real-time monitoring of EMBs’ computer systems by international observers or forensic audits of any stage of the electoral process to investigate interference, manipulation, hacking, and counter claims, is now a necessity. At the same time, the extent to which international monitors can be trusted to be non-partisan is of equal importance and could reduce forum shopping over time. "

Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.  REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.  INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped.  PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested.  I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

legitime," Subject: California Update 5/4/01  If you have any questions, please contact Kristin Walsh at (713) 853-9510.  Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is  reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into  the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.   Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of  contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).   According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.   Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis.  SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.    The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.  "

legitime," Subject: Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed    Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed  doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then  among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that  the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large  part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which  the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman  began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or  answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had  some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce  demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would  export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty  strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner  out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and  if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the  agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray Subject: Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed    Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?

legitime," Subject: Sagewood Town Homes  I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units. We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

legitime," Subject: Thoughts on Presentation  It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The  WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,  which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes  the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but  there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual""  generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their  generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you  will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california  munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,  if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply  schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said  all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on  the generation side.  On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While  they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is  better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the  load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.  I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with  others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas  demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,  especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the  UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal  consumer then it is obviously a different story.  Let's talk. "
legitime," Subject: Transport p&l  Phillip-- I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange  to me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be  an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is  O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to  get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and  I'll take care of it..  On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate  curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of  $235,019.    (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your  overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects  something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal  #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988) Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to  GDP-Kingsgate.  Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five  different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for  withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a  Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is  that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport  losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.   I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a  systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems  that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,  the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the  detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it  appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be  an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar  impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in  case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the  volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.  "

The point of this  meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is  comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those  who are managing the books believe in the model's results.

legitime," Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls  Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W.

legitime," Subject: Wow Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I  have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.   The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the  distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for  power quality reasons.  The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due  to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm  trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months  due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand,  Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude  awakening in the next 2-3 years.  Subject:   Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on                  Local Utilities                    ( September 05, 2000 )                     In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in  Tukwila.                         The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and  computer servers for the                  region's growing number of dot-coms.                         Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up  construction                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than  a mile from its                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several  fiber optic backbones, the                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and  eventually                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,  Microsoft and Onvia.com.                         Exodus is not the only company building massive data  centers near Seattle.                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,  Globix and                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house  the networking                  equipment of the Internet economy.                         It is a big business that could have an effect on  everything from your                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access  your favorite Web sites.                        Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and  server farms, are                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent  Valley that some                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and  Puget Sound                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,  high-security                  facilities.                         ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that  are requesting 445                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,""  said Karl                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound  Energy. ""That is                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.""                         A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,  the rise of the Internet                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their  heads.                         Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington  Utilities and                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new  data centers. The                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing  residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations  necessary to support                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20  million each,                  Karzmar said.                         Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to  bring up the data center                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                         For the utilities that provide power to homes,  businesses and schools in the                  region, this is a new and complex issue.                         On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing  appetite for power --                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The  facilities run 24 hours a                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a  constant revenue                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that  they could                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital  expenditures.                         Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will  mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate.                         ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense  loads,"" said Bob Royer,                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle  City Light.                         ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium  lights at the football                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.  We have data                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40  and 50 megawatts.""                         With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate  complex in Tukwila is                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased  the 1.35 million                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from  Boeing Space &                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased  92 percent of the                  six-building complex to seven different co-location  companies.                         ""It is probably the largest data center park in the  country,"" boasts Laurent                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG  Communications,                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama  Networks all                  lease space in the office park.                         After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,  Sabey has become an                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under  management or                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole  claims his firm is                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in  the country.                         As more people access the Internet and conduct  bandwidth-heavy tasks                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for  co-location space in                  Seattle continues to escalate.                         But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center  space is growing at a                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,  causing similar                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and  California.                         Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location  space, plans to nearly                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year.  While companies                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many  high-tech companies                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such  as Exodus that                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic  management.                         ""We have 2 million square feet of space under  construction and we plan to                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more  demand right now                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account  executive at Exodus in                  Seattle.                         The booming market for co-location space has left some  in the local utility                  industry perplexed.                         ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do  to serve the growth,""                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is  almost stunned by this, in                  a way.""  "

legitime," Subject:	Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed     Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray   Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?  Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed price gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens? "

legitime," The French poetic tradition inclines to lines of a regular metrical length, usually linked by rhyme into couplets or stanzas. German poetry depends more on rhythm and stress, with repeated consonants (alliteration) to bind the phrases. Elegant or subtle rhymes have a courtly flavour. The hammer blows of alliteration are a type of verbal athleticism more likely to draw applause in a hall full of warriors.  Both traditions achieve a magnificent flowering in England in the late 14th century, towards the end of the Middle English period. Piers Plowman and Sir Gawain are masterpieces which look back to Old English. By contrast Chaucer, a poet of the court, ushers in a new era of English literature.  "
legitime," The identification and estimation of dynamic causal effects is a defining challenge of macroeconometrics. In the macroeconomic tradition dating to Frisch (1933) and Slutsky (1937), dynamic causal effects are conceived as the effect, over time, of an intervention that propagates through the economy, as modelled by a system of simultaneous equations. Restrictions on that system can be used to identify its parameters. In a classic result by the namesake of this lecture, Sargan (1964) (along with Rothenberg and Leenders, 1964) showed that full information maximum likelihood estimation, subject to identifying restrictions, is asymptotically equivalent to instrumental variables (IV) estimation by three stage least squares. The three stage least squares instruments are obtained from restrictions on the system, typically that some variables and/or their lags enter some equations but not others, and thus are ‘internal’ instruments – they are internal to the system. The massive modern literature since Sims (1980) on point-identified structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) descends from this tradition, and nearly all the papers in that literature can be interpreted as achieving identification through internal instruments. In these models, structural shocks are the interventions of interest, and the goal is to estimate the dynamic causal effect of these shocks on macroeconomic outcomes. "
legitime," The last two decades of economic decline in Africa have drawn attention to the crisis of masculinities, to “failed men” unable to build kinship networks and to “violent men” who damage social networks whilst competing for scarce resources. This article argues that a fragmented, neo-liberal society also produces new patterns of patriarchal aggrandisement. Focusing on Johannesburg's minibus-taxi industry, it shows how large informal sector activities are structured through kinship networks that in turn give rise to modes of masculinity seeking to control these networks. Johannesburg's minibus-taxi business is dominated by retrenched labour migrants, who moved into the transportation sector in the 1980s and 1990s at a time of industrial decline. It thus offers a case study of the changing patterns of accumulation and household formation in a social landscape where kinship ties continue to constitute the key relationships of obligation and support. Drawing on three-dozen core interviews with Zulu-speaking taxi owners and transporters, this article demonstrates that the taxi owner and the taxi boss are men to be emulated, but that the relationships between “big men” and “failed” or “violent” men are uncomfortably close.

Though some redwoods, which have remarkable rejuvenating abilities, may be able to survive the flames, Ms. Shive cautioned that trees that were scorched will not look the same. Their trunks might be intact, but some tree crowns — the tops — were likely incinerated and will take years to regrow. "
legitime," The practice of misappropriating and stealing huge sums of public money under the guise of enhancing national security has come under increasing scrutiny in Nigeria. This article investigates the history and practice of the use of so-called security votes, and shows how the ambiguity and secrecy associated with the concept of national security has helped institutionalize unaccountable governance at all levels of government. Tracing the use and abuse of security votes from the military regime of General Babangida to the present democratic era, the article argues that the misappropriation of security votes has expanded in recent years. It suggests that the problem is rooted in the rentier nature of the Nigerian state, not in the inadequacy of fiscal rules, and concludes that it will remain difficult for citizens to hold their leaders to account as long as the country continues to depend on oil rents.

Scammers may propose marriage and make plans to meet in person, but that will never happen. Eventually, they will ask for money.

legitime," The state or public sector includes institutions and organisations. The state takes some of the earnings from the business companies and households, and uses it to pay for ""public goods"" like streets or education, to be available for everyone. The last subject is foreign countries. This includes all households, business companies and state institutions, which are not based in one's own country. They demand and supply goods from abroad. The objects (things acted upon) in economic study are consumer goods, capital goods, and factors of production. Consumer goods are classified as ""usage goods"" (for example, gasoline or toilet paper), as ""purpose goods"" (for example, a house or bicycle), and as ""services"" (for example, the work of a doctor or cleaning lady). Capital goods are goods which are necessary for producing other goods. Examples of these are buildings, equipment, and machines. Factors of production are work, ground, capital, information, and environment.  "

legitime," The success of Kenya’s garment export sector relative to other African countries challenges a growing pessimism regarding the prospects of devising and implementing industrial policy in contemporary Africa, particularly in contexts characterized by Competitive Clientelism. Kenya became sub-Saharan Africa’s fourth largest exporter of garments by value during the last two decades, catching up with major players like Lesotho and South Africa while converging on the two largest exporters, Mauritius and Madagascar. Nuancing existing explanations for the sector’s growth, which emphasize external factors like trade regimes and donor interventions, this article assigns a central role to the state and the balance of power that underpins it. The interests of key actors within Kenya’s political settlement aligned in a way that allowed the country’s Export Processing Zones (EPZ) programme to be relatively insulated from political pressures, giving the Export Processing Zones Authority (EPZA) sufficient autonomy and coordination capacities to administer a highly-conducive business environment for predominantly foreign garment firms. However, while the sector’s employment and foreign exchange contributions have ensured ongoing political support, the resulting increase in garment firms’ holding power has made them more assertive in demanding policies that are not only decoupled from learning processes, but detrimental to other industry players.

legitime," The thing is, most of the time, she’s absolutely right. She is the most talented singer in many scenarios. However, the tool these singers have that she lacks is the audacity to put themselves out there. They believe they’re good enough to be heard by the world, and sometimes that can trump the talent card. Believing in yourself and having the confidence to see your dreams through is a huge part of success. If you want to grow creatively, you have to embrace the vulnerability it takes to risk failure. You must get in the arena to let your voice be heard, as it’s hard to grow your talent from the sidelines. Don’t sell yourself short in life. The resentment you may feel towards other artists for varying reasons is a waste of energy, and it won’t serve you in reaching your own goals. "
legitime," There are limitations in the explanatory power of prevailing theories on the political economy of Africa’s growth without industrialization that emphasize the resource-curse, ethnicity, neopatrimonialism, and the developmental state. This article uses a political settlements approach to explain the institutional underpinnings of Nigeria’s economic transition. It shows how external constraints on ruling elites interact with the distribution of power and institutions to stimulate episodic reforms in an ‘intermediate’ Nigerian state. Rather than a ‘developmental’ state presiding over industrial upgrading or a ‘predatory’ state operating solely on neopatrimonial basis, this intermediate state presides over selective reforms and bursts of economic growth and diversification. Thus, specific constraints in Nigeria’s post-military political settlement from 1999 generated the initial impetus for successful telecoms liberalization, while inhibiting growth in the oil sector. This article contributes to advancing the political settlements framework in applying it to resource-rich countries, by outlining the four dimensions of the distribution of power and the constraints for institutional persistence or change, and their varying economic implications. It also reclaims the concept of ‘elite bargains’ as a defining feature of the horizontal distribution of power and demonstrates its centrality to the durability or fragility of institutions, especially at critical junctures of resource booms and busts.

legitime," This article analyses the process and outcomes of Ghana's 2008 elections, which saw the National Democratic Congress replace the New Patriotic Party and thus an alternation of ruling party for the second time since (re)democratization in the early 1990s. It argues that Ghana's democratic political system survived the closeness and intensity of the 2008 elections because it has developed stabilizing characteristics: an independent Electoral Commission and transparent electoral processes, integration of the political elite alongside the creation of norms and institutions structuring elite behaviour, and the institutionalization of political parties. The closely competitive elections are the result of a two-party system where voters and political elites are mobilized around two political traditions. These political traditions provide ideological images, founding mythologies and political styles for the parties. Thus, Ghana is different from several African countries where parties split or form around leaders, who bring their popular support base with them. It is also different in that elections are not dominated by ethnic politicization, because the two main parties in Ghana have a strong political support base in most regions and party identification is based on cross-cutting social cleavages of which ethnicity forms only one part. "
legitime," This article considers the economic effects of corporatization processes in Africa through an analysis of the intervention of French media companies in the economy of Nigerian video film distribution in French-speaking West Africa, and particularly in Côte d'Ivoire. In a global context that is marked by the price volatility of raw materials such as oil and copper, screen media have been described as the new ‘African black gold’, attracting the interest of a large number of both African and non-African players and setting in motion a process of the ‘corporate takeover’ of African screen media industries. Analysing this process can help us to understand wider economic transformations in Africa. This article examines what we might call the ‘technopolitics’ of Nigerian video films’ circulation and their historical transformations by examining the micro-dimension of the experiences of a number of West African video film producers and distributors, and the macro-dimension of the activities of a French corporation, CanalPlus, which is investing in Nollywood's distribution. It argues that Nollywood has acquired a strategic function for French enterprises that are investing in Africa, as evidenced by the transformation of Côte d'Ivoire's role in the economy of Nigerian video films’ transnational circulation. This suggests a new and transformed dimension to France's economic and political relationships with sub-Saharan Africa, as well as a more nuanced assessment of the politics of African neoliberalism. "
legitime," This article interrogates the emergence of drug trafficking in contemporary Ghana and West Africa within the context of a global political economy, situated within a deeper historical perspective. It examines the earlier trafficking of cannabis along the coast of West Africa in the colonial period, and the later transnational networks that have emerged to promote international drug trafficking (cocaine and heroin). The article probes how the African diaspora and international travel service these emerging drug networks in Ghana, West Africa, Europe and the Americas. It suggests that the concept of an ‘ideological diaspora’ could shed light on a shared global popular culture, which constitutes a counter culture and rationalizes criminal activities. "
legitime," This article is an analysis of the boycott of the polio vaccination campaign in northern Nigeria, which has indefinitely stalled global polio eradication targets. The polio immunization drive was brought to a standstill in July 2003 as religious and political leaders in northern Nigeria responded to fears that the vaccines were deliberately contaminated with anti-fertility agents and the HIV virus. The article explores the political and cultural angles of this controversy, revealing deeper dimensions that have contributed to the rejection of polio vaccines in northern Nigeria. In doing so, it argues that there is an underlying logic to public anxieties often dismissed as ‘anti-vaccination rumours’. Although the polio vaccine boycott has proved costly in both economic and human terms, it has opened important lines of communication at global and national levels, potentially deepening dialogue, participation and sensitivity necessary for global health campaigns. Although immunization comes with countless benefits, it is a complex and difficult health strategy to enforce. Decisions on broader health as well as immunization goals are often made at a global level to be incorporated and adapted into national health plans and budgets. Evidently for immunization campaigns, the journey from the global to the local is a vulnerable and unpredictable one. "

legitime," This implies that in the near future the extent of the Arctic ice caps will be greatly reduced and even completely ice-free during the summer. Besides the environmental effects, another consequence of this climatic phenomenon is the possibility of opening up the Northern Sea Route (NSR) for high volume commercial traffic. This shipping route will connect East Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China) with Northwestern Europe through the Arctic Ocean (see Figure 1). In practical terms, this represents a reduction in the average shipping distances and days of transportation by around one third with respect to the currently used Southern Sea Route (SSR). These reductions translate not only into fuel savings and overall transport costs but also to significant transport time savings that may effectively force supply chains in industries between East Asia and Europe to change. They also imply high shipping volumes through the Arctic, likely adding to underlying shocks to the ecosystem. "

legitime," This Research Note reflects on the question of representing marginalized people’s voices by discussing field research based on open-ended narrative interviews with rural populations that had been displaced by natural resource extraction in Mozambique. It highlights the methodological challenges of representing narratives of the marginalized by discussing several aspects of the politics of narrative. On the one hand, narratives that emerge in fieldwork encounters are contingent articulations of oneself that unfold through the implicit negotiation process between a researcher and a research participant. On the other hand, these narratives are embedded in broader socio-material relationalities. Through this discussion, the Research Note demonstrates how these methodological aspects of the politics of narrative should be reflected upon as a way to navigate complex ontological narratives that emerge in one’s fieldwork, as well as highlights how this narrative reading overcomes the potential danger of fetishizing individual agency and/or overlooking broader structural inequalities.

legitime," To think of crime in terms of risk and rewards, punishment and incentives has a long lineage. Jeremy Bentham in his 1830 book The Rationale for Punishment already applied utilitarian logic to the sanctions applied to criminal offenders. In economics itself, research in earnest began with the seminal work by Becker in the 1960s. His and other early work was mostly theoretical. Since then, a rich empirical literature has evolved looking at the social, cultural and economic determinants and consequences of crime, as well as the factors driving punishments. In this virtual issue, we showcase some of the latest thinking on the economics of crime, published in recent years in The Economic Journal. The range of articles published spans the entire globe, from post-riots London to Vietnam, China and the US; it looks at determinants of crime ranging from school leaving ages, drinking laws, and sex ratios to military conscription; and it highlights policy-relevant insights, such as in the link between medical marijuana laws and US crime rates.

legitime," We use rich microdata on bank robberies to estimate individual-level disutilities of imprisonment. The identification rests on the money versus apprehension trade-off that robbers face inside the bank when deciding whether to leave or collect money for an additional minute. The distribution of the disutility of prison is not degenerate, generating heterogeneity in behaviour. Our results show that unobserved heterogeneity in robber ability is important for explaining outcomes in terms of haul and arrest. Furthermore, higher ability robbers are found to have larger disutilities, suggesting that increased sentence lengths might effectively target these more harmful criminals. "

The land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.  Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now.  If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will know more on this question later today.  Sincerely,  George W.

legitime,"George,  Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate  project:  Ownership Structure  What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?  What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what  capacity(regarding ownership and  liabilities)?  Who owns the land? improvements?  Who holds the various loans?  Is the land collateral?  Investment  What happens to initial investment?  Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?  Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?  When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment  schedule?  Investment Return  Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?  Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits  are distributed?  Debt  Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral  is associated with each  loan?  Improvement  Construction  Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.  Terms of each loan?  Uses of Funds  How will disbursements be made?  By whom?  What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing  for investors?  Reports to track expenses vs plan?  Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?  What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get  paid a markup on subcontractors as a  general contractor and paid gain out of profits?  Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses  before the ultimate payout of profits?  Design and Construction  When will design be complete?  What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?  What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction  planning and permitting?  Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors,  vendors, and other professionals?  Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?  Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to  use? Names?  These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor  in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as much as possible from the process.

legitime,"Laird,  Did you meet with SWG on April 27th.  Are there any other asset management  targets in the west?  Subject: SW Gas  Janie,  Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.  We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to  discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to  gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.   Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are  typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?   How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main  contacts at SW Gas?  We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our  control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably  have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the  commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their  commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)  should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month  index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That  risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of  their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.  As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are  there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly  appreciated.  Thanks,  Laird   "
legitime,"Liane,  As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to  manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered the  marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices  ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the  time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15  cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to  report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of  line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.  We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:  1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.   2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and        October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that  are dramatically different.   I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index.  It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to  conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me  anytime I can assist you towards this goal.  Sincerely,  Phillip Allen "
legitime,"Phillip, Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the  requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport  trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;  the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,  on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic  consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time  consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the  inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the  consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can  arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to  happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the  consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude  building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the  future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm  requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project  plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.  The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to  themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this  project. I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been  good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now  we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve. From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated  positions, I think we still have the following issues: We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had  three meetings which brought out very different issues from different  traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader  requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to  be outside the scope of position consolidation. Things left to do: I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to  make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this  project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this  project and which fall out of scope. For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and  work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all  drill downs. Use the above to formulate a project plan. Things requested thus far (no particular order): Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal  ticker. Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that  add up existing position manager rows/columns). New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical,  transport, swaps, options, ... Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values  of all curves on which the desk has a position. Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be  shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid  would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the  appropriate positions to show for each: Gas Daily for monthly index, Physical gas for Nymex, Physical gas for Inside Ferc, Physical gas for Mid market. Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of  using official valuations. Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks. Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS: Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility  skew and correlations. Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.   Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a  gamma grid. Valuation of Gas Daily options. A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD. Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets. Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position  manager. Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms,  prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change. Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker. Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of  individual deals on the position total in a grid cell. Benchmark positions in TDS. Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit  and explicit position break out issues. PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for  transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that  point. "

legitime,"STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.  REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.  INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped.  PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested.  I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

legitime,"Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W.
